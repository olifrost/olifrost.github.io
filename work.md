Here's some more of the work I've done for brands or causes.

I worked at AMV BBDO for five years, spent time at Droga5, BBH, Mother, and made [my first book](/student) at the Watford Ad Course.

I once won gold for Creative Circle's 'Most Promising Newcomer', which wouldn't sound like a compliment if I was given it now.

{% assign projects = site.data.brands %}
{% for item in projects %}
    {% include project.html project=item %}
{% endfor %}
