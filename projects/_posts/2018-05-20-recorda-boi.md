They said it wasn't "cool".

So I decided to prove them wrong, and went on Britain's Got Talent.

After the performance a documentary crew came to see me.

In 2019, I made fans [over a hundred personalised songs](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18029842834212127/).

The mission to repopularise the recorder remains very much on hold, as I continue my journey to [Refrost The Planet](/refrost).

But for the occasional booking, birthday shoutout, or large amounts of cash, I pick up the recorder again.
