It was a common problem for a lad like me

People put things in your diary when the football is on.

And you can't watch football.

So sad.

As a massive lad I knew this well.

So I made a <a href="http://olifro.st/calendarblocker">calendar blocker for the world cup</a>.

It puts lies in your calendar.

So you can watch the game.

See you at the pub, lads.

Fork this on GitHub for whatever reason.
