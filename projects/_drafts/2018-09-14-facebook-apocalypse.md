Join us in the act of mass deactivation â€“ as we depart from the world of Facebook to a higher plane of existence.

[>> Facebook Apocalypse: A Mass Deactivation](https://www.facebook.com/events/233180084041543/)

Together we will find a new, better way to wish each other happy birthday, or announce when we lose our phones.

The date sits at the beginning of the site's fifteenth year, and the New Roman calendar.

This is the leaving party, and all of Facebook is invited.
