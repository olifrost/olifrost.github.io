If you're [@realolifrost](https://instagram.com/realolifrost/), who's the fake one?

Well his name is Oli Frost.

And at sometime in 2011, he decided to steal my username.

He posted a few terrible photos, and disappeared.

Now it's already hard enough being called Oli.

After my parents gave me it, it "coincidentally" became the most popular name in the UK.

And then there's the myriad of spellings: Oli, Olly, Ollie, (the list goes on).

I'm not a vain person.

I may have been on television, but I only look at myself in the mirror when there's a mirror there.

Yet I couldn't let someone else profit from my importance.

I checked the username's availability for over a decade.

But still nothing.

So I reported him.

There was no identity theft option, so I chose 'spam'

Blocked, I had denied this man the right to ever look at my content again.

And I felt no regret.

That is, until one day, I got cyberbullied myself.

A hurtful comment was left on one of my selfies.

So I stalked the bully to an old thread he posted on Reddit.

And tried to do something about the pain I was feeling.

Our conversation went on for days.

But besides what I learnt my facial hair, [and the massage industry](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bt7nbx/i_am_a_male_massage_therapist_in_orlando_florida/), and

I had learned what cyberbullying felt like from the other side.

To feel threatened by just being who you are.

I decided I would never cyberbully anybody again.

Unless they really deserved it.
