## The Vampire Conspiracy (Part I) Lyrics
Of course climate change is a conspiracy   
Made up by socialist vampires to push policies   
A greener fairer world that's our evil plot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
We'll build clean energy to improve air quality   
Creating lots of jobs with fair pay guaranteed   
A well-being revolution that's our evil plot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
And recycling is a lie   
To make you go outside   
The night you take your bins out   
Is the night we bite   
   
We'll tax the frequent fliers and make the trains free   
Covering your planet with lots of lovely trees   
Stress is a pollution we don't want blood to clot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
Smart meters are a lie   
So you invite us inside   
We hide in hi-vis   
So we catch your eye   
(To mesmerise you)   
   
So now you know our plan to descale economy   
Measure growth in happiness instead of GDP   
Don't try to warn the others   
It's already too late   
The next blood we drink is running in your veins

## Vampire Conspiracy (Part II) Lyrics

So you've heard our evil socialist vampire plot
For the greenest fairest world with the most delicious blood
Your werewolf leaders say we would make you less free
But how free is their wolf ideology?

Are you free?
When market forces keep you on a leash
Are you free?
Chasing sticks that are always out of reach
Are you free?
Working for the wolves that want for more and more
Maybe it's time to serve vampire overlords

As long as it's not garlic we'll make sure you have enough
Not devouring you entirely just taking a little blood
It's only wealthy wolves that we'll make into our pets
Fill the skies with bats instead of private jets

Are you free?
Eating scraps while they're wolfing down a feast
Are you free?
When morality is treated like a treat
Are you free?
Placing all your profits in the master's paw
Maybe it's time to serve vampire overlords

They say you're selfish, it's just in your nature
To fight one another, to be a lone wolf
It's just a myth they maintain to keep you in chains
I taste community running in your veins

So be free
To pursue non-blood-based activities
So be free
Free from werewolves mauling your family
So be free
Come on invite me in what are you waiting for?
You know it's time to serve vampire overlords
