# The Pirate Emergency Lyrics

Every pirate was the same  
We could not wait for climate change    
The seas would swallow all the land  
We’d cheer and raise our hook and hand  
  
One day a girl boarded the ship  
A Swede heading to a summit  
She said you’ve got the whole thing wrong  
Who will you loot with everyone gone?   
  
Hi! Ho!  
Whats happening on the high seas?  
Don’t you know?  
It’s a pirate emergency  
  
Though we are above the law  
We all stopped using plastic straws  
Straight from the keg we’d drink our rum  
Until one day we stumbled upon  
  
The great Atlantic garbage patch   
Even looked big with an eye patch  
Turns out that we misplaced the threat  
The patch was mostly fishing nets  
  
Hi! Ho!  
Whats happening on the high seas?  
Don’t you know?  
It’s a pirate emergency  
  
If we saw a fishing boat  
We’d try to board to slit their throats  
Protecting fish protects the sharks  
We want walking the plank to last   
  
Years went by with many dead  
Until one day my parrot said  
These fisherman are just a victim  
Of an economic system  
  
Hi! Ho!  
Whats happening on the high seas?  
Don’t you know?  
It’s a pirate emergency  
  
We stayed on land ’til anchors rust  
But politics just weren’t for us  
It seemed that all hope was lost  
Then we came across Oli Frost  
  
He said just do what you do best  
Knowing yourself’s a treasure chest  
Just write a jaunty sea shanty  
To make your point seem less preachy
