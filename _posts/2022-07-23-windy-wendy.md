## Windy Wendy Lyrics

She took the house and she took the car  
But when she took my child I knew she’d gone too far  
I’d even blame Annabelle for the rain  
And making me afraid to fly on planes  

'Cos Annabelle’s not a woman  
She’s a hurricane  
She’s man and woman made  
You better be afraid  
Her friends and her get worse every decade  

After Annabelle came Bethany  
I don’t know why I thought she’d be good for me  
It started well, we met by the sea  
But Bethany started suffocating me  

Oh Bethany’s  
Not a woman  
She’s a tsunami  
Yes climate change can bring us more of these  
There’s tectonic shifts when the icecaps unfreeze  

Christopher wasn’t my usual type  
He sure was pretty, but cold as ice  
And when he met momma he was very rude  
Yes Chris turned mom into an ice cube  
  
But Christopher's not a man  
He’s a snow storm  
I know a warmer planet is what we fear  
But it causes more moisture in the atmosphere  
  

There was Hannah the Heatwave   
and Danny the Drought  
For a few years there I really got about  
But my poor past won’t didn’t decide my forecast for me  
We all deserve a world that isn’t so stormy  
That’s why…  

My Wendy is actually  
A wind turbine  
She's a boundless source of energy  
I don’t mind she’s a little taller than me  
  
Oh Wendy  
Will you please marry me  
There’s a space in my yard just for you  
I don’t mind if you spoil the neighbour's view  
  
Oh Wendy  
I love you  
And I’m selling my truck  
and buying an electric truck  
Second hand  
And also taking the train  
Mostly
