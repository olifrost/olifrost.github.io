*Performance begins at 02:45*


The next day I wrote a complaint letter to The Sun.

> Recorda Boi <recordaboi@gmail.com>  
> Sun, May 20, 1:20 AM  
> To: exclusive@the-sun.co.uk  
> I’d like to talk to someone about my mistreatment on last night’s Britain’s Got Talent  
> Oli

The paper replied almost immediately.

> SM - Sun, News <news-sm@the-sun.co.uk>  
>Sun, May 20, 3:13 AM  
> To: me  
> Hi Oli,  
> We are interested. Can you tell us what happened please?  
Many thanks,  

So I told them

To: The Sun
> Thanks very much.
>
> Last night I watched Britain’s Got Talent, only to find the footage the show used did not reflect what really happened.
>
>The show took my story and simply edited it out, choosing to turn it into a comedy act.
>
> In the beginning I told the judges about my struggle with school bullies who told me the recorder wasn’t a cool instrument.
>
> I talked about the journey from that playground nickname ‘Recorder Boy’ to becoming Recorda Boi.
>
> And overcoming the shame of being a recorderist.
>
> The audience clapped and cheered me on hearing this.
>
> This was removed.
>
> After the performance I told Simon he was just like the bullies back in the playground.
>
> This was removed.
>
> I told David Walliams that it’s not about what you play it’s about what you do with it.
>
> This was removed.
>
> And in countless interviews off stage I told a story which was never included.
>
> For background, here is a little about the story I told throughout the audition.
>
> The recorder is the first instrument kids learn, but instead of teaching them music they like, we teach nursery rhymes.
>
> With a simple change we could create a whole new generation of musicians.
>
> But instead the show’s hosts chose to talk to me about songs like ‘London Bridge’, ‘Three Blind Mice’ and ‘If You’re Happy And You Know It Clap Your Hands’
>
> Nursery rhymes will not inspire kids to learn music. Hip-hop will.
>
> Their use of editing left people with the same old idea - that playing recorder is a joke.
>
> And so every 8-year old in the country will have to suffer learning Itsy Bitsy Spider for years to come still.
>
> It was my dream to be the Pied Piper of a new generation of musicians.
>
> But the show chose to lead children into a very different cave.
>
> Even the performance itself did not reflect what happened, as they removed my cover of Gangsta’s Paradise - a crowd favourite on the night.
>
> Thankfully I have had fans write to me since to say they felt the same - which is what inspired me to come forward.
>
> Here is a link to the clip https://youtu.be/UhMwFOlSrc8
>
> I’m happy to provide any other details.
> Thank you
