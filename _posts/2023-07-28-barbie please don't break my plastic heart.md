## Barbie Please Don't Break My Plastic Heart Lyrics
Barbie please don’t dump me I don’t biodegrade  
I’ll be ocean garbage ‘til the end of days  
I’ll sink into the deep where I’ll suffocate a shark  
Barbie please don’t break my plastic heart  

Seems like every Ken is just a single-use item to you  
I’ve seen the way you look at other figurines  
If not for me, for pollution Barbie, you can do your part  
Barbie please don’t break my plastic heart  

But if it can’t be me I hope you settle down with a nice wooden boy  
Pinocchio might be a puppet but he’s not your toy  
If Action Man steals you away for an action-filled weekend  
I’ll be in pieces, but with you until the end  

Because love lasts forever in micro-plastic parts  
Even if you break my plastic heart  
I’ll be in the water you drink and every breath you take  
Even if my plastic heart should break
