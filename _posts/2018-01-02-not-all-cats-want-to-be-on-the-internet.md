Back when Keyboard Cat and Grumpy Cat were almost household names.

And like any cat owner at the time I too wanted my cat to be famous.

I always knew Gabby was somehow special.

When she was just a kitten she was featured on The Daily Kitten, a prestigious cat blog at the time.

She was pretty but in an interesting and unconventional way.

A rogue ginger patch on her forehead made her unmistakeable.

She has even been [featured on the Facebook page of the local vet](https://www.facebook.com/VillageVetMeldreth/photos/a.289767831387612.1073741829.279734152390980/503026170061776/?type=3&theater) just for coming in.

> "Gorgeous Gabriella has a personality that matches her beauty. Lovely lovely girl. She came in for a scale and polish yesterday to keep her teeth pearly white and healthy. Have you got a cat with a coat like this?"

So I started to imagine what Gabby's own channel might look like.

We rehearsed and rehearsed.

And yet when it came to shoot.

Gabby broke down.

She wouldn't ride a horse

Or play table football.

</div>

Or meow into a megaphone.

<p></p>
And then eventually I realised the problem.

Gabby didn't want to be on the internet.

She didn't want fame.

She was one of the millions of normal, web shy cats.

The ones you don't see.

The ones who don't make a fuss when they see a cucumber.

The loveable, down-to-earth furry creatures we love.

So if you're trying to turn your cat into an internet sensation.

Ask whether that's what your cat wants, or what you want.
