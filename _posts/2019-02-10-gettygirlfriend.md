A new phone background.

So with Valentine's coming I wanted to do something to help those without.

By sharing with you my personal wallpaper library.

{% include carousel.html %}

<a href="{{ page.library }}" class="button">Download</a> *Over 150 backdrops, liberated from the GettyImages library.*

GettyGirlfriend contains sassy women, *unsassy* women, and also boys.

Suitable for all sexualities and all device sizes.

I have used all of these at some point in the last year.

But before you begin slut shaming, please hear my story.

# It began with Amy…

![](/blog/getty.jpg)

For the longest time my phone background was one of my three cats.

Freddy, Tibby, and [Robert Mugabe](/blog/not-all-cats/).

But around Valentine's last year I was feeling the pressure.

With a half-drunk bottle of Corona Light in my hand, I went to GettyImages.

I set my search to "girl smiling", there she was.

*Amy*, my ginger dream.

I didn't need to see the 97,494 other results.

Every time I checked the time, it was like time stopped.

(Although when I checked again, it hadn't, although it felt like it did again)

But after a few months, somehow, I started to become *bored* of Amy.

My phone backdrop fell into the backdrop of my *life*.

So one night, I finished my bottle of Corona Light, and went back to Getty.

# And that's how I met Jennifer

Jennifer was everything Amy wasn't.

Artistic, brown hair, wearing a hat.

The girl I thought my life needed.

But sure enough the same thing happened.

After a few weeks I was bored.

Her beanie lost its luster.

And with it, the lust I had for her.

I thought about going back to Amy

But that wasn't *fair* on Amy.

So I had to move on.

# And then there was Georgia

Where Jennifer was brooding, Georgia had a smoothie.

Though I didn't know the flavour, I imagined it tasted full of life.

It was different, but it wasn't better.

It wasn't *it*.

After only a few hours I was back on GettyImages

# And then I was lost

I went through hundreds of backgrounds.

And even experimented with boys.

Did I not know what I wanted?

Or had I just not found it?

Was Amy the right one all along?

I wondered if I could go back.

# But Amy had moved on…

When I went to re-download the picture, I found a new one.

And in this one, Amy had a boyfriend.

![](/blog/getty-10.jpg)


I had left it too long, thinking Amy would wait.

Tears fell, which landed on my screen, which still had GettyImages loaded.

And then through the tear drop I saw her.

# Finally, I saw Amelia
![](/blog/getty-9.jpg)


She looked a bit like Amy.

*She* liked coffee too.

And that's when I realised.

There isn't *one person* for all of us.

There are lots of very similar, almost identical people, who will do just fine.

So when you find a stock image you like, *save them to your downloads*.

Back them up in the iCloud, and never let go.
