# The Vampire Conspiracy Lyrics

Of course climate change is a conspiracy  
Made up by socialist vampires to push policies  
A greener fairer world  
That's our evil plot  
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood  
  
We'll build clean energy to improve air quality  
Creating lots of jobs with fair pay guaranteed  
A well-being revolution  
That's our evil plot  
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood  
  
And recycling is a lie  
To make you go outside  
The night you take your bins out  
Is the night we bite  
  
So now you know our plan to descale economy  
Measure growth in happiness instead of GDP  
Don't try to warn the others  
It's already too late  
The next blood we drink is running in your veins
