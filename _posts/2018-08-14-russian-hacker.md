Russian hackers, they say, are spreading lies that ruin the world.

But if lies got us in this, maybe they could get us out too.

I decided to become a Russian hacker myself, and see what I could do.

I translated my name into Russian – <span class="russian">Оли Фрост</span>.

Ordered a My Little Pony mask to hide my identity.

And started building my own fake news site.

[NFN World News](http://nicenews.live/) is a fake news site that publishes only the nicest lies.

The ones that crush fears, bring smiles, and make you almost want to be a good person.

I was prepared to use whatever means necessary to put the stories out.

From bot networks, to hi-jacking verified accounts.

So I started a Discord server in Russia called Anonynice.

A [channel for my hackers to co-ordinate](http://nicenews.live/joinus).

Next I opened [a Bitcoin wallet to receive offshore financing](http://nicenews.live/donate).

Funds to promote our posts on your corrupt social networks.

And finally, I sent a threat to the news corporations of the world.

It explained my plan to destabilise their negative western media agenda.

Until they publish some real nice news.

A story about blind kittens has already been [shared thousands of times](http://nicenews.live/lonely-blind-cats-see-string/).

The storm has arrived.

Choose your side, and choose carefully.

*Visit [NFN World News](http://nicenews.live/) and spread some niceness.*
