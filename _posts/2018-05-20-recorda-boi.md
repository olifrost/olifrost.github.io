They said it wasn't "cool".

So I decided to prove them wrong, and went on Britain's Got Talent.

After the performance a documentary crew came to see me.

I published my first ebook, <a href="/blog/RecordaBoiGradeBook.pdf">>> Recorda Boi (Grades 3-4)</a>.

Over this time, I received late night phone calls from a group of school friends somewhere in London.

One weekend in 2019, I offered them each a personalised song, which quickly escalated into [over a hundred personalised songs](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18029842834212127/), as more of their friends demanded shoutouts.

The mission to repopularise the recorder remains very much on hold, as continue my journey to [Refrost The Planet](/refrost).

But for the occasional booking, birthday shoutout, or large amounts of cash, I pick up the recorder again.
