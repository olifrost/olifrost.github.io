They said it wasn't "cool".

So I decided to prove them wrong, and went on Britain's Got Talent.

After the performance a documentary crew came to see me.

I published my first ebook, <a href="/blog/RecordaBoiGradeBook.pdf">>> Recorda Boi (Grades 3-4)</a>.

But recently it has gotten harder and harder to get the message out.

In the words of Greta Thunberg (slightly paraphrased)

> "Why should I study recorder for a future that might not exist?"

Kids these days just want to talk about climate change.

If I wanted them to talk about recorders, I'd have to sort that one out first.
