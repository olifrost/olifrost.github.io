And all because people don't like holes in their jumpers.

With birthing season beginning this May, the need for awareness has never been greater.

I'm raising funds for Bob Shipley, who runs the UK's only clothes moth sanctuary.

The sanctuary gives shelter to moths forced out of their moth-hating homes.

Your support will fund the curtains, jumpers, and rollnecks that will feed the moths through the summer.

Please, think of the moths.
