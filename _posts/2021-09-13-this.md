Following my success [shaking up the soda industry](/blog/square-root), I was approached by plant-based meat people This™.

"This™" isn't meat, despite appearing and tasting to be.

We embarked on a number of daring ventures.

We unofficially sponsored the olympics.

Proposed a new office space to the Mayor of London.

And plastered subliminal messaging over the entirety of London

But on Wikipedia, we went full vandal.

Our plan was to change the pictures of bacon, to not bacon.

And not tell anyone.

However, the page was protected by Wikipedia from vandalism.

So only accounts with a proven track record could edit.

To do this, I created an account and made small edits to bacon-related pages.

(Along the way, I was able to stop Bacon College using Wikipedia to boast about the facilities of its for-hire private space).

Once my account was confirmed, I held my breath, and made the change.

And for a while, nobody noticed.

Truth was subverted in the service of good ([and not for the first time](/blog/russian-hacker))

The story broke…

Then Judas emerged.

One of their own followers, an avid Wikipedian, had me banned for life.

Lock me up and throw away the key.

My work here is done.
