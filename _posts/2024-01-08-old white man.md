## Old White Man Lyrics
The doctors say I've just a few years left   
Before I start reading right wing news   
I'll share Facebook memes that are a bit tone deaf   
I'll have everything-phobic views   
   
So please remember me as I am before   
I turn into an old white man   
   
I'll spend my time funding new oil rigs   
in my highly corrupt banking job   
Send emails approving the apocalypse   
from the deck of my mega yacht   
   
So please remember me as I am before   
I turn into an old white man   
   
But what if I keep my mind working   
by doing daily sudokus?   
Could I be one of those woke old men   
Who's not afraid to love tofu?   
   
Please remember me as I am if   
I turn into an old white man   
   
The doctors say there's still some hope   
I'll just start acquiring cats   
I'll buy each one a holiday home   
And knit them all miniature hats   
   
Oh if I'm lucky I'll grow up to be   
Nothing but a posh old white lady
