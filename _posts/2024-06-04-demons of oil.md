## Demons of Oil Lyrics
We witches warned of climate change long ago   
But the demons of oil had a business to grow   
They told the townfolk we cast spells by the moon   
Blamed storms on women who just owned a broom   
   
A world aflame, yet it’s witches they fear   
Demons of oil whispered lies in their ears   
   
Witch hunts began, the town took it as fact   
That poor harvests and droughts were caused by witches’ cats   
They denied the fire each time that it snowed   
Called us hypocrites if we owned an iToad   
   
A world aflame, yet it’s witches they fear   
Demons of oil whispered lies in their ears   
   
The town was near bankrupt from paying for oil   
Were told wind and solar was all warts and boils   
Turned out the town mayor was in on the lies   
The demon’s oil rigs were government subsidised   
   
A world aflame, yet it’s witches they fear   
Demons of oil whispered lies in their ears   
   
Tunnels to hell where gold and oil would flow   
The plans were revealed in leaked demon memos   
The witches and town started working as one   
Chanted a spell powered by wind and sun   
   
Begone you demons, with coin in your eyes   
We won’t work for you and we won’t tell your lies
