With Director of Photography "Mum" and Drone Operator "Dad", I recorded and edited it at my childhood holiday spot on the Isle of Wight.

It's now available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/3WdqFO10RbW4dtrPMqXEiz?si=rjEW7GBvTAWY1q_GE4USfQ), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-greta-thunberg-song-single/1538647164), and (if it still exists) Limewire.

There's also a karaoke version
