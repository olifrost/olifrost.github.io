Back at school I was naturally a bit of a rebel.

Against school policy, I refused to wear my jacket.

Instead, I carried it over my shoulder.

This was cool, but inconvenient.

It meant using my *actual hands*.

So I began to work on a solution.

But like the lightbulb or the first iPod, this took time.

Back then wearable tech wasn't even a thing.

I had to invent it.

And now it's here.

Meet **SHOOK**

The worldâ€™s first hook for shirts.

A revolutionary plastic peg with a Peel-Off-The-Back & Stick-In-Place adhesive layer.

It lets you *stylishly* hang your jacket on your shirt, hands-free.

Modern man's biggest problem is now no more.
