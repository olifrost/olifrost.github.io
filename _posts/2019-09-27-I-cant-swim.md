So of course I was interested, when the student climate network asked me to make some posters for the first global climate strike.

After some research, it seemed my colleagues were already enthusiastic about the chance for a day off.

This informed my highly strategic approach.

To my surprise, the posters were shared and printed by lots of people.

Some were [School Strike For Climate](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2dpJwPAZuq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [Extinction Rebellion](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2W62tAnf63/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [350.org](https://twitter.com/350/status/1173310522596438017), [Upworthy](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oKK7PARL5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and [I Weigh](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2gtSTinqOv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).



The account I made for them gained 25,000 followers in a month, and I decided to keep making them for future events.

This [turned into its own site](/posters), providing templates that were used by strikes in other languages.

They were used up by organisations like [Greenpeace](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5XqpxPjSU8/) and offered press space in The Times.

For Halloween I made masks, which were worn by local school strike groups and even at coal mine protests in Australia.

Right now, I am preparing a new campaign for Climate Strike "Online".
