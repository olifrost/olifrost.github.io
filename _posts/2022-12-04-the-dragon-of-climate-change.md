# The Dragon of Climate Change Lyrics

There once was a terrible dragon
Whose name was climate change  
He slept atop a mountain  
As he'd done for an age  
  
'Til the king made the poor  
mine the mount for gold  
The dragon gave a scary roar  
And out of bed he rolled  
  
Lo! The dragon of climate change hath come  
But slay the beast named greed and that dragon will be done  
  
The king lied to the peasants  
He blamed the dragon on them  
And sold them pointless weapons  
So he could casheth in  
  
But when flames razed the town  
The folk saw through his scheme  
'tis a wood house the dragon burns  
But not your stone keep  
  
Lo! The dragon of climate change hath come  
But slay the beast named greed and the dragon will be done  

The king summoned a mage  
He said would end this chapter  
He promised a spell called  
Direct Air Carbon Capture  
  
It could keep the dragon away  
While the gold forever grew  
But soon they found out the mage  
Was just the king's court fool  
  
Lo! The dragon of climate change hath come but  
But slay the beast named greed and the dragon will be done  
  
The people marched from town  
On horse the king fled  
The dragon saw his shiny crown  
And barbecued his head  
  
Folk shared the kingdom's riches  
So they had all they need  
The dragon's home was left alone  
So he could get some sleep  
  
Lo! The dragon of climate change was done.  
But beware the beast named greed or he won't gone for long
