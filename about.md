# FAQ

## Do you really need an FAQ?
Not sure yet.

## Where are you from?
I was born London but I'm currently [seeking citizenship in São Tomé](/blog/sao-tome-citizen/).

## Why do you have a coat hook on your shirt?
It's a [SHOOK]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-03-shook-shirt-hook %}).

## When a shirt becomes a pyjama shirt can it ever go back?
Only for short trips to the shops.

## Did you create this dope website with Wix?
No, all my work is traditionally hand-coded.

## Will you do something for me?
[Ask me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). As long as it's not weird…

## Love your work, can I buy you a coffee?
No. If you'd like to support my work please [buy me a cat](https://paypal.me/olifrost). Any amount donated on the PayPal link will be saved towards the lifetime cost of said cat (around £17,000). Your name will go on his collar.

## Can I still buy all your personal data?
[Sure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-27-data-on-ebay %}), it'd be quicker than answering all these questions.

## What are you doing next?
It'll be on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.author.instagram }}">Instagram</a>, or this old school <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}?subject=I'd like to join the mailing list&">mailing list</a>.

## How do you feel the FAQ went?
I think it was alright. Maybe not self-deprecating enough?
