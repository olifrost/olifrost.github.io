# FAQ

## Do you really need an FAQ?
Not sure yet.

## Where are you from?
I was born in Hackney, London – back when it was edgy – but I am currently [seeking citizenship in São Tomé](/blog/sao-tome-citizen/).

## Why do you have a coat hook on your shirt?
It's a [SHOOK](/blog/shook-shirt-hook/).

## Do you have any qualifications?
I did Philosophy at UCL – I learnt to question the meaning of life and (more often) the meaning of a philosophy degree.

## When a shirt becomes a pyjama shirt can it ever go back?
Only for short trips to the shops.

## Did you create this dope website with Wix?
No, all my work is traditionally hand-coded.

## Will you do something for me?
[Ask me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). As long as it's not weird…

## Will you play recorder at my event?
Ask [Recorda Boi](http://olifro.st/blog/britains-got-talent/)</a>.

## Can I buy all your personal data?
[Sure](http://olifro.st/blog/data-on-ebay/), it'd be quicker than answering all these questions.

## What are you doing next?
It'll be on <a href="https://twitter.com/realolifrost">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realolifrost/">Instagram</a>, or this old school <a href="mailto:mail@olifro.st?subject=I'd like to join the mailing list&">mailing list</a>.

## Shouldn't you have a list of coverage here?
Ok, if you insist… *BBC, Channel 4 News, Vice, UK Parliament, Britain's Got Talent, The Guardian, New York Post, DAZED, Huffington Post, Mail Online, Fox News, Forbes, ABC, It's Nice That, Refinery 29, Business Insider, Creative Review, Lifehacker, UNILAD, LadBible, Fast Company, Designboom, The Independent, The Telegraph, Gizmodo, Motherboard, i-d, Metro, Shortlist, Evening Standard, RT, Mic, Stylist, Al Jazeera, The Big Issue, Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News #1, CNET, Design Taxi, Creative Circle '17 Best New Talent*.

## How do you feel the FAQ went?
I think it was alright. Maybe not self-deprecating enough?
