# FAQ

## Do you really need an FAQ?
Not sure yet.

## Where are you from?
I was born London but I'm currently [seeking citizenship in São Tomé](/blog/sao-tome-citizen/).

## Who makes your stuff?
I do. I'd get help from friends, but they're [harder to make](/refer).

## Will you do a thing for me?
I'm really short on hands (currently just two) but send me an email, I'll [consider anything](mailto:mail@olifro.st)…

## How did you get into this?
Can you have a scroll through my [post archive](https://olifro.st/blog/) and let me know?

## Have Lambeth Council asked you to stop impersonating them?
At the time of writing, I believe they are [not aware]({% post_url 2019-06-12-little-tips %}).

## How do you feel the FAQ went?
I think it was alright, so so really.
