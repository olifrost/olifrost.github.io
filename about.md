# FAQ

## Do you really need an FAQ?
Not sure yet.

## Where are you from?
I was born London but I'm currently [seeking citizenship in São Tomé](/blog/sao-tome-citizen/).

## Who makes your stuff?
I do. I'd get help from friends, but they're [harder to make](/refer).

## Tell me some meaningless numbers to quantify your importance?
200k followers, 20 million views, 1 person recognising me in Franco Manca

## Will you do a thing for me?
I'm really short on hands (currently just two) but send me an email, I'll [consider anything](mailto:mail@olifro.st)…

## How do you feel the FAQ went?
I think it was alright, so so really.
