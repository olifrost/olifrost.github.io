![Oli Frost](/img/olifrost.jpg)

I'm Oli Frost, the guy who [put all his personal data on eBay](http://olifro.st/blog/data-on-ebay/), played [recorder for Simon Cowell](http://olifro.st/blog/data-on-ebay/), and started the [Instagram faking service Lifefaker.com](http://lifefaker.com).

My work has been featured everywhere from [UK Parliament](http://thehomelessperiod.com) to [Britain's Got Talent](http://olifro.st/blog/britains-got-talent/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/10f77fff-06ed-4c11-a91a-d1413df96d23) to [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/05/30/facebook-user-auctions-personal-data-on-ebay-for-99-cents-and-bids-soar-sell-it-to-advertisers-or-whatever.html), and [It's Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/nice-fake-news-website-oli-frost-digital-010818) to ["Cheezburger"](https://cheezburger.com/3832325/flopstarter-unveils-a-series-of-twisted-inventions-which-would-never-appear-on-kickstarter).

# FAQ

## Do you really need an FAQ?
Not sure yet.

## Where are you from?
I was born London but I'm currently [seeking citizenship in São Tomé](/blog/sao-tome-citizen/).

## Why do you have a coat hook on your shirt?
It's a [SHOOK](/blog/shook-shirt-hook/).

## Do you have any qualifications?
I did Philosophy at UCL but never found out: 'why?'

## When a shirt becomes a pyjama shirt can it ever go back?
Only for short trips to the shops.

## Did you create this dope website with Wix?
No, all my work is traditionally hand-coded.

## Will you do something for me?
[Ask me](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}). As long as it's not weird…

## Will you play recorder at my event?
Ask [Recorda Boi](http://olifro.st/blog/britains-got-talent/).

## Can I still buy all your personal data?
[Sure](http://olifro.st/blog/data-on-ebay/), it'd be quicker than answering all these questions.

## What are you doing next?
It'll be on <a href="https://twitter.com/realolifrost">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realolifrost/">Instagram</a>, or this old school <a href="mailto:mail@olifro.st?subject=I'd like to join the mailing list&">mailing list</a>.

## How do you feel the FAQ went?
I think it was alright. Maybe not self-deprecating enough?
