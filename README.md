## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Each project is stored as an MDX file in `src/content/year/project`.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

This site is configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Deployment Setup:
1. The repository is configured to deploy to the custom domain: `https://olifro.st`
2. The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles the build and deployment process
3. A CNAME file in the `public` directory ensures the custom domain is properly configured

### Manual Deployment:
If needed, you can manually trigger a deployment from the Actions tab in GitHub.

## Design

The site's design follows these principles:
- Color scheme: black, blue, and white
- Light, minimal, brutalist aesthetic with a nod to early web
- Custom "internet blue" color defined in global.css
