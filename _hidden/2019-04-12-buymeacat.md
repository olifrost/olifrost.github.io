## Why You Should Buy Me A Cat

I've seen people on the internet say "Hey, if you like my work, buy me a coffee".

I would much rather you [buy me a cat]({{ page.paypallink }}).

The lifetime cost is only around £17,000 and I will put your name on his collar.

And while Cats do have a carbon pawprint.

The happiness will likely prevent other consumerism in my life.

If you cannot afford to buy me a cat, [please buy me a plant]({{ page.coffeelink }})

I am currently shopping for small succulents, and Chinese money plants.
