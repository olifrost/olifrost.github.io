I worked at AMV BBDO for five years, spent time at Droga5, BBH, Mother, and made [my first book](/student) at the Watford Ad Course.

I once won gold for Creative Circle's 'Most Promising Newcomer', but in fact, I rarely promise anything at all.

<div class="posts" markdown="0">
{% assign projects = site.data.brands %}
{% for item in projects %}
    <h2>{{ item.category }}</h2>
    {% include project.html project=item %}
{% endfor %}
</div>
