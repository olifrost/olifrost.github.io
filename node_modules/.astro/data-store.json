Getty Images.\n\nI set my search to \"girl smiling\", and there she was.\n\n*Amy*, my ginger dream.\n\nI didn't need to see the 97,494 other results.\n\nEvery time I checked the time, it was like time stopped.\n\n(Although when I checked again, it hadn't, but it felt like it did again)\n\nBut after a few months, somehow, I started to become *bored* of Amy.\n\nMy phone backdrop fell into the

wasn't.\n\nArtistic, brown hair, wearing a hat.\n\nThe girl I thought my life needed.\n\nBut sure enough the same thing happened.\n\nAfter a few weeks I was bored.\n\nHer beanie lost its lustre.\n\nAnd with it, the lust I had for her.\n\nI thought about going back to Amy\n\nBut that wasn't *fair* on Amy.\n\nSo I had to move on.\n\n# And then there was Georgia\n\n![](@assets/2019/getty-3.jpg)\n\nWhere Jennifer was brooding, Georgia had a smoothie.\n\nThough I didn't know the flavour, I imagined it tasted full of life.\n\nIt was different, but it

experimented with boys.\n\nDid I not know what I wanted?\n\nOr had I just not found it?\n\nWas Amy the right one all along?\n\nI wondered if I could go back.\n\n# But Amy had moved on…\n\nWhen I went to re-download the picture, I found a new one.\n\nAnd in this one, Amy had a boyfriend.\n\n![](@assets/2019/getty-10.jpg)\n\n\nI had left it too long, thinking Amy would wait.\n\nTears fell, which

By applying you agree to being contacted with a friendly \"Hi\" to start proceedings but agree it would be better form if you said \"Hi\" first. Our conversations should continue for long enough for you to make one accidental video dial. You must reply to messages within three days unless you have been extremely busy or otherwise flat out. If it feels the conversation has come to an end you agree it would be polite to 'Like' the last message. You should occasionally send high-five or clapping hands to my Instagram Story. You agree not to comment on my posts with fire emoji and stick to colder emojis such as the frost snowflake. You must offer pity likes to unpopular Instagram posts. And pity laughs to unpopular anecdotes at social events. You must be ready to invite me to your birthday if you are having more than a small to medium sized thing. You must not be disappointed if I'm the first person to arrive at your small to medium sized thing. You must be comfortable with me borrowing a jumper for up to a week. You must be comfortable with unpaid debts of up to £5. You must be prepared to hold my beer for longer than one minute. If you have a spare ticket to something I'd enjoy, you must at least consider inviting me before choosing someone else. You must share at least ten impersonal facts about yourself, three fairly vulnerable ones, and one crushing truth that causes you sleep deprivation. Only one of these facts can be an inventive lie. You must be willing to look through one full photo album from my childhood (at best, this will be delivered as an interactive powerpoint presentation). On Mondays you should not feel obliged to ask how my weekend was because we're past that now. You must offer a list of six potential in-jokes that we can revel in conspiratorially as best friends. We must have one song that we both like that is not in the Top 40. You can correctly identify mannerisms that are like mine and use the expression \"That's so Oli\". You must be able to name one of my three cats. You must agree that my cat is a genius. In the pre-friend stage you may be tested on any of the above points at any time – should you fail to react or answer correctly you may have to wait a minimum of 14 days before friendship is re-evaluated. As an experienced friend, I'm very open to feedback. If you have any comments on the process, please put your thoughts in an email and send them to me. You are allowed to choose a preferred method to receive funds after completion, but not Venmo as I don't have that yet.\u003C/p>\n    \u003C/div>\n  \u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cstyle>\n{`\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  from { opacity: 0; }\n  to { opacity: 1; }\n}\n\n.{\n  animation: fadeIn 2s forwards;\n  animation-delay: 0.5s;\n}\n\n.whitespace-nowrap {\n  white-space: nowrap;\n}\nlite-youtube {\n  max-width: 100% !important;\n  margin-left: auto !important;\n  margin-right: auto !important;\n}\n`}\n\u003C/style>","src/content/2019/refer-a-friend.mdx",[652],"@assets/2019/refer/refer-thumb.jpg","3d8040453ea63cac","2019/the-social-lamp",{"id":654,"data":656,"body":662,"filePath":663,"assetImports":664,"digest":666,"deferredRender":25},{"title":657,"description":658,"date":659,"image":660,"tags":661},"I made my lamp a social media personality","(What happened next will shock you).",["Date","2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_@assets/2019/lamp-bio.jpg",[19],"![](@assets/2019/lamp-bedside.jpg)\n\nWe all know climate change is caused by leaving the lights on.\n\nBut some days I left the house and couldn't remember if I'd turned them off.\n\nI didn’t want to go home and check – I might miss my work’s free breakfast.\n\nSo as part of my mission to Refrost The Planet, I came up with a way for my lamp to let me know what it was up to.\n\nBy turning it into a social media personality.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-bio.jpg)\n\nMy bedroom lamp might be bright – but intelligence-wise, it was very dim.\n\nSo I purchased a smart plug to connect the lamp to the internet, and a Google robot to connect the plug to my thoughts.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-setup.jpg)\n\nThen all I had to do was connect the Google to an app called IFTT, which would activate an app called Stringify, that would simultaneously activate my smart plug’s own app, as well as [my lamp's new Twitter account](https://twitter.com/lampy08).\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-system.jpg)\n\nI then set the message to change with the time of day, and gave the lamp a few accounts to follow (so it wouldn't feel bored or objectified by its work).\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-tweet.jpg)\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-tweetnight.jpg)\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-recruiting.jpg)\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-profilepic.jpg)\n\nI ran the system for nearly a year.\n\nClimate change seemed to be in safe hands…\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-tweetstime.jpg)\n\nBut in around May, I logged back on to my lamp's account to find tens of unread notifications.\n\nFrom a moth.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-moth.jpg)\n\nEvery time the light tweeted at night, [the moth tweeted back](https://twitter.com/haroldmoth).\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-mothtweets.jpg)\n\nI had no idea who created it – was it a friend trolling me, or an unusually tech-literate moth?\n\nI couldn't risk a moth getting in and putting more holes in my plain t-shirt collection.\n\n\nLuckily, I was already in possession of one its greatest enemies.\n\nA window.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-windowprofile.jpg)\n\nMy plan was to use a sensor to detect when my window was open or closed.\n\nIf it was open at night, it would make sure the lamp was off.\n\nAnd if it was closed, it could tell the moth to take its flappy wings elsewhere.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-window-tweet.jpg)\n\nBut before I could begin, I made a terrible discovery.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-meter.jpg)\n\nMy Smart Meter read £2.20\n\nUsually at this time of day, it was £2.16\n\nMy simple system was costing the earth, and not just in money.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-plugs.jpg)\n\nFor days I felt defeated.\n\nThe guilt told me to do nothing, that saving the planet was hopeless.\n\n## But this was too important to give up\n\nSo I came up with a simpler plan.\n\nThe next day, I created a mental note to look at what state the lamp was in each morning.\n\nThen, using a box of museli I installed in my kitchen cupboard, I was able to create a backup system.\n\nWhen I was unsure if the lamp was on, I could go home, and have breakfast there instead.\n\n![](@assets/2019/lamp-museli.jpg)\n\nThe plan worked.

an old white man   \n   \nThe doctors say there's still some hope   \nI'll just start acquiring cats   \nI'll buy each one a holiday home   \nAnd knit them all miniature hats   \n   \nOh if I'm lucky

\n   \nMesmerise, mesmerise     \nOn the count of three     \nYou'll want to nationalise     \nYour private utilities     \n   \nMesmerise, mesmerise     \nJust focus on my voice     \nYou'll want to
