*Don't like my bio? Build your own with my **[Bio Builder →](/bio-builder)***

I'm Oli Frost, I make songs, films and websites about the climate crisis. [Greta Thunberg did the macarena](/blog/the-greta-thunberg-song) to one of them.

Recently I took a shellphone to the UN Ocean Conference, created a [fossil fuel divestment game](/blog/asset-manager-quest) about asset management, and made a [wellness app for oil executives](/blog/oilwell). 

My work has been featured everywhere from [UK Parliament](/blog/thehomelessperiod) to [Britain's Got Talent](/blog/recorda-boi), [BBC](/blog/lifefaker) to [Fox News](/blog/data-on-ebay), in [music festivals](/blog/latitude), [art shows](/blog/refer-a-friend), and [on bins](/blog/little-tips). 

Its given me 330,000 followers, over 75 million views, and a complex psychological relationship with numbers.

At the moment I am creating campaigns with Serious People, a climate campaign studio I co-founded, and creating weekly videos for Greenpeace.

**So how did you end up doing… this?**  
Ok that's a long one…

In 2015, I made a website with a petition that ended up in parliament. I started thinking if I made more websites, more interesting things would happen.

I made [Flopstarter](/blog/flopstarter), a crowdfunding platform for bad ideas, and [LifeFaker](/blog/lifefaker), which provides you with the photos to fake a better online life. I also did things like [selling my personal data on eBay](/blog/data-on-ebay). These projects got coverage from Fox News, BBC, Vice, Fast Company, Product Hunt, and, ex-Blue Peter presenter, Richard Bacon, did a segment.

In 2018, by accident, I sent I ended up [playing recorder on Britain's Got Talent](/blog/recorda-boi), somewhat by accident. This took my work in a different direction…

In 2019, I started making climate "content". I created [posters for climate strikes](/blog/climate-strike-posters) that were shared by organisations like Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and 350.org, and used at protests around the world.

From 2020, I started making songs about the climate crisis, which eventually started getting many views online. Greta Thunberg danced to [The Greta Thunberg Song](/blog/the-greta-thunberg-song) amd [The Vampire Conspiracy](/blog/the-vampire-conspiracy) series became my most popular work. I've played at [Latitude Festival](/blog/latitude) and had songs featured on Spotify editorial playlists.

Since 2022, I've been making weekly videos for Greenpeace, covering everything from [fracking](/blog/fracking-is-good) to ocean protection. I've taken a [shellphone to the UN Ocean Conference](/blog/shellphone), played a tiny violin for oil executives, and helped make over a hundred videos.

In 2024, I co-founded [Serious People](https://seriouspeople.org.uk), a climate campaign group that combines some of all of the above. We've created projects like [Asset Manager Quest](/blog/asset-manager-quest), [opened a fossil fuel funfair](/blog/fossil-fuel-funfair), and launched a fake advertising agency [Atmospheric](/blog/atmospheric). This year it was covered Financial Times.
