I'm Oli Frost, I make songs, films and websites about the climate crisis. [Greta Thunberg did the macarena](/blog/the-greta-thunberg-song) to one of them.

Recently I took a shellphone to the UN Ocean Conference, created a [fossil fuel divestment game](/blog/asset-manager-quest) about asset management, and made a [wellness app for oil executives](/blog/oilwell). 

My work has been featured everywhere from [UK Parliament](/blog/thehomelessperiod) to [Britain's Got Talent](/blog/recorda-boi), [BBC](/blog/lifefaker) to [Fox News](/blog/data-on-ebay), in [music festivals](/blog/latitude), [art shows](/blog/refer-a-friend), and [on bins](/blog/little-tips). Its given me 330,000 followers, over 75 million views, and a complex psychological relationship with numbers.

For these projects, I handle most of the production myself - the filming, recording, editing and web development. I also collaborate with others, and in 2024 co-founded Serious People, a climate campaign studio.

## How I got here

I started making websites in 2015. Things like [Flopstarter](/blog/flopstarter), a crowdfunding platform for terrible ideas, and [LifeFaker](/blog/lifefaker), which generates fake social media posts. I also tried [selling my personal data on eBay](/blog/data-on-ebay), which made it to the front page of Reddit before eBay banned me. These projects got coverage from Fox News, BBC, Vice, Fast Company, Product Hunt, and Richard Bacon on his radio show.

By a strange turn of chance, I [played recorder on Britain's Got Talent](/blog/recorda-boi) in 2018, which took my work in a different direction entirely.

In 2019, I started making climate "content". I created [posters for climate strikes](/blog/climate-strike-posters) that were shared by organisations like Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and 350.org, and used at protests around the world.

From 2020, I started making songs about the climate crisis. They started getting millions of views online. [Greta Thunberg danced to The Greta Thunberg Song](/blog/the-greta-thunberg-song), [The Vampire Conspiracy](/blog/the-vampire-conspiracy) series became my most popular work, and songs like [The Pirate Emergency](/blog/the-pirate-emergency) and [The Dragon of Climate Change](/blog/the-dragon-of-climate-change) followed. I've played at [Latitude Festival](/blog/latitude) and had songs featured on Spotify editorial playlists.

Since 2022, I've been making weekly videos for Greenpeace, covering everything from [fracking](/blog/fracking-is-good) to ocean protection. I've taken a [shellphone to the UN Ocean Conference](/blog/shellphone), played a tiny violin for oil executives, and helped make over a hundred videos.

In 2024, I co-founded [Serious People](https://seriouspeople.org.uk), a climate campaign group. We've created projects like [Asset Manager Quest](/blog/asset-manager-quest), a video game about fossil fuel financing that was covered in the Financial Times, [opened a fossil fuel funfair](/blog/fossil-fuel-funfair) called Ogilvyland to annoy WPP, and launched [Atmospheric](/blog/atmospheric), a fake advertising agency that helps companies "Keep the Fire Burning™". This year it was covered Financial Times.
