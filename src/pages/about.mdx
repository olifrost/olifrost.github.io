**Will you do something for me?**  
Maybe. [I will listen to anything…](mailto:mail@olifro.st)

**Who makes your stuff?**  
For these projects, I handle most of the production myself - the filming, recording, editing and web development.

**How can I support your work vampire overlord?**  
You could [send me a tip](https://ko-fi.com/olifrost), join my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/OliFrost/membership), or [stream my music](https://olifro.st/links).

**So how did you end up doing… this?**  
Ok that's a long one…

<BioExpander summary="See more">
In **2015**, I made a website with a petition that ended up in parliament. I started thinking if I made more websites, more interesting things would happen.

I made [Flopstarter](/blog/flopstarter), a crowdfunding platform for bad ideas, and [LifeFaker](/blog/lifefaker), which provides you with the photos to fake a better online life. I also did things like [selling my personal data on eBay](/blog/data-on-ebay). These projects got lots of press.

In **2018**, I filmed a video of me playing hip-hop on a gold recorder, and accidentally ending up playing it [for Simon Cowell](/blog/recorda-boi). This is how I started appearing "in" videos.

In **2019**, I realised the world wasn't doing too well and focussed these projects on the climate crisis. I made some unusual videos on ["recycling"](/blog/little-tips), and created [posters for climate strikes](/blog/climate-strike-posters) that were used around the world.

From **2020**, I made a song that Greta Thunberg would eventually dance the macarena to. This did well, so I made [a lot of them](/tags/music), including a song about [socialist vampires](/blog/the-vampire-conspiracy))  which had many millions of views.

Since **2022**, I've made weekly videos for Greenpeace, debunking common myths about environmental issues. I've also taken a [shellphone to the UN Ocean Conference](/blog/shellphone), and [delivered a tiny violin to Shell](/blog/tiny-violin).

In **2024**, I co-founded [Serious People](https://seriouspeople.co), a small climate campaign group. We were recently covered in The Financial Times for projects like [Asset Manager Quest](/blog/asset-manager-quest) and our fossil fuel funfair [Ogilvyland](/blog/fossil-fuel-funfair), and launched a fake advertising agency [Atmospheric](/blog/atmospheric).
