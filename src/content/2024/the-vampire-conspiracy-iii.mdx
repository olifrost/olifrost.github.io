## Lyrics
Socialist vampires     
Want to control your mind     
Force you to put profits     
After needs of humankind     
   
I'll make you improve healthcare     
Environment and wage     
Free-range organic humans     
Have the most delicious taste     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
Look in my undead eyes     
I'll trap you in a world     
Where you'll love being alive     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
You'll never feel as free     
As serving vampire masters     
Who serve your human needs     
   
We'll make your polluters     
Hug bunnies and trees     
You'll drink non-holy water     
That's microplastic-free     
   
We'll take commercial landlords     
And put them in a trance     
Make them lower rents     
And then do a silly dance     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
You're falling into sleep     
A Friday morning lie-in     
On a four-day working week     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
When my fingers snap     
You'll believe the wealthy     
Should pay a lot of tax     
   
Do air-frying machines     
Seem to haunt you in your dreams?     
You want a new one     
But you can't work out why     
It's wealthy werewolves who push schemes     
Through your television screens     
My poor friend     
You're already mesmerised     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
On the count of three     
You'll want to nationalise     
Your private utilities     
   
Mesmerise, mesmerise     
Just focus on my voice     
You'll want to hear it more     
And no, it's not a choice
