## Lyrics
Climate change is an administrative nightmare   
In the offices of death   
I have to file a form for every single human   
There's spreadsheets of each dead insect   
   
But grim reaper management denied our request   
to put project climate on hold   
We had to protect shareholder interests   
By meeting our quota of souls   
   
Climate change is an administrative nightmare   
In the offices of death   
I cried when I missed my Little Grimlings' science fair   
Ms Grim thinks I might be depressed   
   
So we formed a reaper trade union   
To make sure our whispers were heard   
But the change fell short of a revolution   
We just got a scheme for cycling to work   
   
So we took control of the lake of souls   
We do the scything we know how it works   
Got rid of manager roles   
Set new business goals   
So the afterlife would have to put life first   
   
Climate change is an administrative nightmare   
But there's a way out of this hell   
If you support the system that's soulless and unfair   
You'll soon hear the toll of my bell
