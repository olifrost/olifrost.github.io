It's now available to stream [everywhere](https://olifro.st/links), but can also be sung at home, to reduce energy consumption. Stats from [OurWorldInData.org](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector)

## Lyrics

The planet's warming every year  
And the human cause is very clear  
So in each sector, in each year  
Let's see greenhouse gases get here  
  
Rice cultivation's 1%  
Wastewater isn't much different  
2% from deforestation  
Same for shipping and aviation  
  
Similar stat for landfills  
Agriculture and fishing, and chemicals  
Burning crops is over 3%  
Same goes for mixing cement  
  
You don't have to like addition or be a mathematician  
I'm not actually a scientist I'm more of a musician  
There's only one thing that you need to know  
All these emissions have got to go  
  
Science and learning can be so much fun  
They tell you where greenhouse emissions come from  
Stats and numbers turned into a song  
It's useful to know things  
We'll die if we're wrong  
  
4% fertilises crops  
6% just for livestock  
Cattle and sheep both ruminate  
Methane warms at a quicker rate  
  
7% from Iron and steel  
Commercial buildings are a similar deal  
10.9 is residential  
Road transport's even more essential  
  
Fugitive emissions from energy production  
Unallocated fuel combustion  
Together are about 13.6  
Sounds important, whatever it is  
  
The rest comes from other industry  
Paper and pulp and machinery  
Petrochemicals non ferrous metals  
Food, tobacco, and overfilled kettles  
  
Just quick aside  
I'm not telling lies  
But many of these facts have probably been revised  
Rounded up and down, and simplified  
You remember it more when it rhymes  
  
Science and learning can be so much fun  
They tell you where greenhouse emissions come from  
Stats and numbers turned into a song  
It's useful to know things  
We'll die if we're wrong
