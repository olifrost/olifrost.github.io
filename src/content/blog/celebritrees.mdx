## Celebritrees Lyrics

Sometime in the future we can talk to trees   
Turns out in their last life some were celebrities   
Now everyone wants a selfie with Elm Elvis Presley   
And the spruce tree Bruce Lee got a kung fu tree movie   
   
Oh I could never cut down a tree   
When it might be a dead celebrity   
Tell the loggers they'll have to log through me   
These celebs must be managed sustainably   
   
Trees are on our talk shows telling anecdotes   
That guy that judged talent shows now does it as an oak   
And tree gossip's always on the front page of the news   
Like when tree Gwyneth Paltrow gets divorced or sued   
   
Oh I could never cut down a tree   
When it might be a dead celebrity   
Tell the loggers they'll have to log through me   
These celebs must be managed sustainably   
   
But what if a tree can't act or sing?   
Why can't that tree be worth something?   
If it's good for the mind and it's good for the earth   
Why does it have to be Chris Hemsworth   
Or Chris Pine   
   
Oh I could never cut down a tree   
When it might be a dead celebrity   
And even if it hadn't been on TV   
I'd still treat that tree like a VIP
