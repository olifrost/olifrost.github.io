## Lyrics

It was a cold night  
I woke up with a fright  
To find Santa sitting there  
Under the tree lights  
  
He said what's the point of me  
What do I stand for?  
I'm just holiday prop  
Here to make you buy more  
  
Oh Santa  
Don't cry Santa  
Sure they can dress like you but there's no one like you, Santa  
  
He said Rudolph fly high  
I want to jump from the sky  
We can't afford to waste  
Another mince pie  
  
Every present I give  
Is a future I stole  
When I buy kids more stuff  
It melts the North Pole  
  
Oh Santa  
Don't cry Santa  
You're the father of Christmas where's your self-forgiveness, Santa?  
  
I said Santa you don't need to kill yourself  
It's not about gifts, just ask any elf  
You're there for every child who wants to believe  
There's more to life than we see  
  
Santa stood up  
And seemed to smile  
Said I'm just getting some air  
I'll be little while  
  
He climbed up the chimney  
I heard a thud on the floor  
Ran outside to find Santa  
Lying dead at my door  
  
Oh Santa  
Don't die Santa  
You're breaking my heart plus your sleigh's double parked  
Oh Santa  
  
Next day I went down  
To a black magic store  
Read up on spells  
And prayed some more  
  
Sat down by your grave  
And sang a song to hell's hounds  
And then your zombified hand  
Shot up through the ground  
  
Oh Santa  
Undead Santa  
You're not quite the same now you want to eat brains  
Oh Santa  
  
Picked up my guitar  
And took a clean swing  
Blood splattered the walls  
As I stood over him  
  
The stockings might be empty  
Now that you're gone  
But in us your kind spirit  
Should always live on  
  
Oh Santa  
Goodbye Santa  
You made us all buy stuff but taught us all kindness  
Oh Santa  
Ho ho Santa
