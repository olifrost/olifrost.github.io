## Lyrics

So you've heard our evil socialist vampire plot  
For the greenest fairest world with the most delicious blood  
Your werewolf leaders say we would make you less free  
But how free is their wolf ideology?  

Are you free?  
When market forces keep you on a leash  
Are you free?  
Chasing sticks that are always out of reach  
Are you free?  
Working for the wolves that want for more and more  
Maybe it's time to serve vampire overlords  

As long as it's not garlic we'll make sure you have enough  
Not devouring you entirely just taking a little blood  
It's only wealthy wolves that we'll make into our pets  
Fill the skies with bats instead of private jets  

Are you free?  
Eating scraps while they're wolfing down a feast  
Are you free?  
When morality is treated like a treat  
Are you free?  
Placing all your profits in the master's paw  
Maybe it's time to serve vampire overlords  

They say you're selfish, it's just in your nature  
To fight one another, to be a lone wolf  
It's just a myth they maintain to keep you in chains  
I taste community running in your veins  

So be free  
To pursue non-blood-based activities  
So be free  
Free from werewolves mauling your family  
So be free  
Come on invite me in what are you waiting for?  
You know it's time to serve vampire overlords
