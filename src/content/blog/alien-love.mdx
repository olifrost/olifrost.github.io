## Lyrics

Humans don't cause climate change   
It's aliens disguised as farmers on a cattle range   
We rear more cows than earth can sustain   
'Cos aliens need cows to watch them when they procreate   

We rear them to abduct them, it's just always been this way   
We don't ask why you drink their milk or have to worship steak   
We know we'll destroy this world, raising cows this way  
But aliens need cows to watch them when they procreate  

But one day my favourite cow entered me  
Entered my mind by telepathy  
And he said  

Could you make robocows that don't release methane?  
And how 'bout VR emulations of a cow's gaze?  
Then he mind moo'd a thought that would never leave my brain  
Do aliens need cows to watch them when they procreate?  

Why can't aliens just make alien love?  
We are staring down the barrel of our own ray guns  

So I tried using cows a little less everyday  
When you find aliens you love, you leave the cows to graze  
There is no better planet in this sector of space  
So let's just probe some humans and give the cows a break
