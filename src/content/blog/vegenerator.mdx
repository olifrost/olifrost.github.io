Gone plant-based for the new year, but struggling for ideas? 

A wise someone once said “all fancy-sounding plant-based recipes are just the name of three vegetables”.  

So we decided to put that theory to the test.

Vegenerator uses uncomplex non-machine learning to generate completely new and untested recipes.

These have not been passed down through generations. 

Your grandma didnt make Tomato, Leek and Mushroom Lasagna. 

But maybe your grandchildren will.  

And there's more exciting features coming in Version 1.1  
- Budgetify (Removes avocado, pearl barley, etc.) 
- Americanify (Refers to aubergine as egg plant) 
- Seasonify (Removes non-seasonal vegetables) 
- Falafel Wrap Mode (Only shows falafel wraps)
