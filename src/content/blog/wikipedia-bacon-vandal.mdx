My plan: change the pictures of bacon on Wikipedia, to plant-based bacon.

And not tell anyone.

However, the page was protected by Wikipedia from vandalism.

So only accounts with a proven track record could edit.

To do this, I created an account and made small edits to bacon-related pages.

(Along the way, I was able to stop Bacon College using Wikipedia to boast about the facilities of its for-hire private space).

Once my account was confirmed, I held my breath, and made the change.

And for a while, nobody noticed.

Truth was subverted in the service of good ([and not for the first time](/blog/russian-hacker))

The story brokeâ€¦

Then Judas emerged.

He repoted the change, and had me banned for life.

Lock me up and throw away the key.

My work here is done.

We embarked on a number of daring ventures.

We unofficially sponsored the olympics.

Proposed a new office space to the Mayor of London.

And plastered subliminal messaging over the entirety of London
