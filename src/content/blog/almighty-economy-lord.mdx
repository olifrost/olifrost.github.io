## Lyrics
Oh divine economy, my holy ghost  
GDP, hallowed be! Grant us eternal growth  
We'll sacrifice kids and send earth up in smoke  
Almighty Economy Lord!  

The trickle-down gospel is righteous and fair  
Wealth will rain down from our blessed billionaires  
Commodify everything – even the air  
Almighty Economy Lord!  

Markets crash! Central bank show us grace  
Protect corporate profit, bail out their mistakes  
Please save the rich, our archangels and saints  
Smite me Economy Lord!  

The prophets of profit will divine our needs  
Not food or friendship – that's just heresy  
More runways, more chatbots, more brand logo tees  
Almighty Economy Lord!  

Earth ignites! Its assets no more  
The space arks depart and wave bye to the poor  
Each man is judged by his last credit score  
Smite me Economy Lord!  

In heaven we pay off our judgement day loans  
In prayer call centres we answer your phones  
How many shifts 'til our souls are our own?  
Almighty Economy Lord!  

Heaven falls! By St Bezos's hand  
He sold off the clouds so we're joining the damned  
Was it the free market or part of your plan?  
Can you hear me Economy Lord?
