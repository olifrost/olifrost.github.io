According to the Frosties Swimming School, I can't swim more than 400m.

So for my own sake (and everyone else's), I obliged.

To my surprise, the posters were shared and printed by lots of people.

Some were [350.org](https://twitter.com/350/status/1173310522596438017), [Extinction Rebellion](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2W62tAnf63/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [School Strike For Climate](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2dpJwPAZuq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), [Upworthy](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oKK7PARL5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and [I Weigh](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2gtSTinqOv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).

The account I made for them gained 25,000 followers in a month, and I made [a site that I updated for future climate events](/posters).

The new posters were used by organisations like [Greenpeace](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5XqpxPjSU8/), offered press space in The Times, and translated into several different languages.

[For halloween I made masks](/blog/fossilghouls), which were worn by local school strike groups and at coal mine protests in Australia.

And by the end of the year, I had been invited to talk on a panel about the UK election and the climate, organised by Lily Allen.

At end of the night, Lilly said thanks for coming.

I also got to meet Lily's boyfriend.

*David Harbour*, from Stranger Things.

Which really made it all worth itâ€¦
