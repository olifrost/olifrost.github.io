Domestic Rebellion is a civilised disobedience movement that activists engage in from the comforts of their own home.

Its acts are of an anti-capitalist anti-consumerist nature with the goal of creating a sense of urgency around the #ClimateEmergency.

The above videos document our first three operations. Operation Straw, Project Nap, and Plan Hand Dryer.



The rebellion operates through a secure private group chat where rebels are notified of daily actions to participate in â€“ you must DM [@olifro.st](https://www.instagram.com/olifro.st/) to request access.
