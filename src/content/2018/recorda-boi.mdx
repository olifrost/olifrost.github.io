I also released a sheet music book, Recorda Boi (Grades 3-4). Available to buy an [eBook](https://ko-fi.com/s/8a70be38cb)

In 2019, I made fans [over a hundred personalised songs](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18029842834212127/).  

The mission to repopularise the recorder remains very much on hold, as I continue my journey to Refrost The Planet.

But for the occasional [booking, birthday shoutout, or large amounts of cash](https://ko-fi.com/olifrost/commissions), I pick up the recorder again.
