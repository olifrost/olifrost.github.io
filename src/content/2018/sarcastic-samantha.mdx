An app that reads your ideas back to you in a sarcastic, patronising tone.

To help you work out if it's any good.

I spent twelve months learning to code.

Developing a sarcastic speech method.

And a random snide remark generator.

Yet it wasn't until near completion that I tested the app on itself.

Nervously, I launched the app and typed in my own idea.

And Sarcastic Samantha responded.

With relentless snarkiness.

I changed the voice to Condescending Karl for another take.

…and then to Sardonic Sara.

I was devastated.

The throwaway nature of my idea had been exposed.

Months of my life lost.

But what did I have to lose?

So I released the app.

In the next year Sarcastic Samantha had 5,000 downloads, and a ★★ rating for its gross lack of technical support

Early reviews on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/sarcastic-samantha) described it as

> "Somewhat useless"

[Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/ios-sarcastic-samantha-privately-mocks-things-with-you-1818822777) and The Huffington Post sarcastically described it as

> "Great"

There is one week left to not enjoy the app that hates itself.
