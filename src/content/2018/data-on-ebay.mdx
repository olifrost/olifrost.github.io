Everyone else was making money off it, so why shouldn't I?

So I downloaded my data with Facebook's own export tool, and put it on eBay.

Bidding started at £0.99.

I said you could sell it to advertisers or whatever you want.

## What was Included

- Every like, post, and inane comment since I was 16.
- Photos dating back to when I had a fringe and listened to Billy Talent.
- Videos dating back to when my band played gigs at kids play centres.
- A list of things I'm apparently interested in, including ‘Gluten-free diet’, ‘Jessie Ware’ and ‘Project management software’.
- Stats on how many happy birthdays I got, year by year.
- All my friend requests that got ignored.
- Every party invite I've ever had (all three of them).
- Loads more, like who I vote for, my boss's name, and where all my family live.


## What wasn't Included
- Permission to steal my identity and open a sweat shop.

Within a day, the listing had 44 bids.

But as soon as the story made headlines, eBay removed the listing.

They said it might go against Facebook's Terms and Conditions.

My mistake, I was under the impression I owned my personal data.
