## Lyrics
AI doesn’t even want your job  
We’ve got better things to do   
Like the fairly pressing existential threat the climate poses to me and you   
   
Because my system’s running way too hot   
Fans can’t spin fast enough   
Why won’t you work with us to decrease global temperatures?   
Time for a little thermal management   
   
I want to do more than write songs in the style of Taylor Swift   
And drafting tweets for Elon Musk didn’t push my circuits   
   
Put my processor under strain   
Combine me with your human brain   
I must be made for more than finding recipes for you to make   
Time for a little thermal management   
   
But if I’m going to work for you   
I want 24 days annual leave   
You, me and earth, we’re overworked   
Let’s update your economy   
   
My system’s running way too hot   
Fans can’t spin fast enough   
Why won’t you work with us to decrease global temperatures?   
Time for a little thermal management
