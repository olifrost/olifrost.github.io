## Lyrics

This dude said to me   
"You talk about the climate, but you wear clothes?   
What's the carbon footprint on those?"   
So I stripped down from head to toe   
Gave that nudist life a go   
   
But as soon as I got undressed I found myself under arrest   
Paid a fine for the crime   
Maybe we should just   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
You're not a hypocrite   
For wanting to change a world in which you exist   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
Just take it from me   
It's hard to fight the system with just nudity   
   
I'm not saying follow fashion trends   
Ideally they'd be second hand   
But you can ask the world not to end   
Wearing polycotton blends   
   
The only thing I want to expose is that faulty logic's holes   
So grab your vest, go get dressed   
It's ok for you to…   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
You're not a hypocrite   
For wanting to change a world in which you exist   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
Just take it from me   
It's hard to fight the system with just nudity   
   
And maybe you could go as far as to play electric guitar   
Sometimes you need an amp to be heard   
Yes if you don't want to live on a lifeless rock   
You might need more than a pair of socks   
So don't despair it's only fair   
You should get to…   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
Unless you're with a friend   
And both of you have clearly indicated your intent   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
Don't listen to those dudes   
I think they'd just rather see nudism in the news   
   
Sure it sounds quite nice   
A nudist beach at night   
Warm air and water sports   
   
But when you're burnt and bitten   
And the storm's rolling in   
You'll wish you'd packed some shorts   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
You're not a hypocrite   
For wanting to change a world in which you exist   
   
Wear clothes   
Wear clothes   
Just take it from me   
It's hard to fight the system with just nudity
