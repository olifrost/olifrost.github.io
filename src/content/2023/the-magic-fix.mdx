## Lyrics

We'll soon have the technology  
To turn CO2 to bubble tea  
And oceans we've acidified  
Will have the taste of apple pie

It's the magic fix we've been waiting for  
We're decades off or maybe more from  
The day they put a unicorn horn on your head

Coral reefs looking grey?  
Blast them with a rainbow ray  
Forests, wetlands, that we've lost?  
Grow trees made of candy floss  
Fish tangled in plastic waste?  
Turn it into strawberry lace  
Replace the glaciers with chocolate ice

By the time it comes it could be too late  
But I guess we'll all just sit and wait for  
The day they put a unicorn horn on your head

Barren land, once a lake?  
Bake it into lemon cake  
Animals gone extinct?  
Resurrect them make them pink  
Soil depletion, wilting crops?  
Plant some magic lollipops  
Turn the oil spills into magic goo

By the time it comes it could be too late  
But I guess we'll all just sit and wait for  
The day they put a unicorn horn on your head

But would that world be all that fun?  
A world patched up with bubblegum  
Is the answer before our eyes?  
Not a pointy spike but just inside

Like not expanding gas and oil  
Managing our land and soil  
Power from the wind and sun  
Powering the things we run  
All the stuff that costs the earth?  
We'll price to reflect their worth  
Then fossil fuel subsidies  
Could fund some things we really need

Public transport? Could be free  
Carbon capture? It's a tree  
Grow food more efficiently  
By eating plants for energy  
Maybe value more than wealth?  
Community or mental health?  
Right the wrongs of time and space?  
Sure why not... We may as well

A transformation's what we need  
Not a phony pony fantasy like  
The day they put a unicorn horn on your head

You're not a horse and it's not too late but  
There's no time to just sit and wait for  
The day they put a unicorn horn on you head

Besides you might bang your horn getting out of bed  
And people might try to hang coats on your head
