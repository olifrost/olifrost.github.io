## Lyrics
I spent 66 million years as a dinosaur ghost   
Watched fossils fuel a new extinction made from my bones   
But you've seen the climate's changing, oh we envy you   
If dinosaurs saw the asteroid we'd do everything we could do   
   
The fast ones would warn the pack, while the tall ones demonstrate   
So the slow political dinosaurs would start to legislate   
While the musical dinosaurs sang a motivating tune   
If dinosaurs saw the asteroid we'd do everything we could do   
   
We wouldn't just save the world, we'd change it for the best   
Stop a few velociraptors taking all the flesh   
We'd spend less time scavenging and have more to watch the sky   
There was good in dinosaurs, we didn't deserve to die   
   
We wouldn't just cross our claws and hope for Jurassic Park   
The continent would gather from T. Rex to Megashark   
When the space rock arrived we'd know we couldn't have done more   
We'd blow that asteroid away with a single mighty roar
