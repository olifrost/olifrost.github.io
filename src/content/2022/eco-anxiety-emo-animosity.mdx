## Lyrics

Being an emo used to be easy  
Crying over breakups and watching MTV  
Now climate breakdown's on my mind  
Losing my girlfriend and all of humankind  
  
Is the whole world literally going to end?  
Does the girl I like really like my best friend?  
I'm kind of afraid of mass extinction  
And when I'm at parties I'm too scared to leave the kitchen  
What happens if there's no Amazon?  
Or I come to registration and call my teacher mom?  
Can this land use change, really be sustained?  
Do you think enough people know that I'm in pain?  
  
Rachel I still love you  
When we kiss again  
I hope it's not in acid rain  
  
Eco anxiety  
The future is a party and nobody invited me  
Emo animosity  
There's no outsiders if there's no society  
  
How do we get net emissions to 0?  
How did Sean's brother beat me on Guitar Hero?  
What happens when we pass 1.5 degrees?  
Why am I so ugly? Rachel's way hotter than me  
How do we increase biodiversity?  
Did they notice my boner during biology?  
Will habitats collapse from population stress?  
I'd just pass out if I saw a girl undress.  
  
Is it ok if I cry?  
Do you think I should I call her  
To apologise my tears are wasting water  
  
Eco anxiety  
I don't want dying in diary  
Emo animosity  
Please don't bury me with my virginity  
  
But this isn't the end  
We can mend  
Rachel will text me back  
As the earth gets back on track  
We'll stop drilling,  
And stop the oil spilling  
Or make it much worse with geo-engineering  
If they blot out the sunâ€¦  
Oh god I've stil got  
  
Eco anxiety  
Rachel your hair looked really nice today  
Emo animosity  
Shut up mom I'm recording right now
