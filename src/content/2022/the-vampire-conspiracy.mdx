## Lyrics
Of course climate change is a conspiracy   
Made up by socialist vampires to push policies   
A greener fairer world that's our evil plot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
We'll build clean energy to improve air quality   
Creating lots of jobs with fair pay guaranteed   
A well-being revolution that's our evil plot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
And recycling is a lie   
To make you go outside   
The night you take your bins out   
Is the night we bite   
   
We'll tax the frequent fliers and make the trains free   
Covering your planet with lots of lovely trees   
Stress is a pollution we don't want blood to clot   
Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood   
   
Smart meters are a lie   
So you invite us inside   
We hide in hi-vis   
So we catch your eye   
(To mesmerise you)   
   
So now you know our plan to descale economy   
Measure growth in happiness instead of GDP   
Don't try to warn the others   
It's already too late   
The next blood we drink is running in your veins
