# Man Creates OnlyFans Account For Planet Earth

## A man has recently gained viral attention for creating an official OnlyFans account for "Planet Earth."

It’s the perfect partnership! While activists overturn all their cards to make the ignorant world focus on the climate crisis planet [Earth](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/social-relevance/flat-earth-society-ends-up-proving-earth-is-round-599222.html) is facing at the moment, one content creator has unlocked the ultimate weapon to catch the internet’s attention.  

## **Man Creates OnlyFans Account For Planet Earth**

Oli Frost is a musician and [content creator](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/human-interest/korean-mom-speaks-punjabi-for-pakistani-creator-598661.html) on social media. In the past, Frost has garnered attention and praise from people on the Internet by using novel ways to spread awareness about the deteriorating health of the planet. This time around, Frost did the unthinkable and put Earth on the subscription service, [OnlyFans](https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/wtf/us-judge-fired-for-moonlighting-as-adult-star-597162.html).

 OnlyFans

The platform, though a place well-known to people, is not exactly the place where people look for climate activists. Frost set up an official account for Planet Earth and added a picture of the planet taken from space as the profile picture. Alongside this, the creator also added the image of smoking chimneys as the banner image of the account.  

Although the creator did set up an account for Earth on the subscription platform, it costs nothing to subscribe to see Planet Earth’s posts on OnlyFans. Frost has made six posts since joining the platform on Earth Day on April 22, 2023, and as per the planet’s bio it is “very hot and dirty.”

## **Frost Introduced The OnlyFans Account With A Video**

Frost introduced his audience to the account with a hilarious video, Frost put on his sleazy voice and narrated away. He said, “Looking for the hottest dirtiest pictures on Earth? Then you are looking for Planet Earth’s OnlyFans page.”

While introducing the account, Frost made some important points to remind people of the grave danger Earth is in. He added, “Can you handle the heat…of a month-long heat wave? Wanna talk dirty…then why not schedule a chat about soil health?”

He continued, “Wanna see Earth change into something a little more…uncomfortable? Our planets tipping points are right on the edge…of a point where it would become very dangerous.” Frost celebrated Earth Day by posting the video and wrote in the caption, “#EarthDay It’s a real page that I made. (Then got carried away and also made the music for this.) Thank you also to @milo.the.moth.goth and @elli.forelli\_ for the help and inspiration for this idea.”

People online praised the content creator for his ingenious idea. One user wrote, “I just love your creative videos around the climate and environmental crisis! Thank you for spreading awareness with a good dash of humor!” While another added, “this is the coolest idea i’ve ever seen in months! your work is going to make the world a better place.”
