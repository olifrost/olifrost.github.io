# Meet the novelty songwriter producing viral hits about…

_Canary Media’s_ [Climate Meets Culture](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/columns/friday-social-where-climate-meets-the-internet) _column explores the intersection of energy, climate and the culture at large._

Oli Frost stands in a cemetery wearing a long, dark coat. With a Transylvanian accent and the backing of a synth-pop beat, he sings, “Of course climate change is a conspiracy, made up by socialist vampires to push policies. A greener, fairer world, that’s our evil plot. Free-range organic humans have the most delicious blood.”

Oli Frost is a climate-change-focused novelty songwriter, and his song [“The Vampire Conspiracy”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9-v5bH7EPE&t=15s) garnered millions of views across platforms like TikTok, Spotify and Instagram last year. It’s a real earworm. Not long after it blew up, [Pique Action](https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fun-stuff/micro-documentaries-on-climatetech-the-electrify-everything-online-community-and-more) and Harvard Chan C-Change named him a [Climate Creator to Watch](https://climatecreatorstowatch.com/) in 2023.

We’ve traded a few emails since then, and I was happy when we finally connected over video chat in August to talk about how he ended up creating novelty songs, his songwriting process and, of course, socialist vampires.  

The following is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation.

**Mike Munsell**: Can you introduce yourself?

**Oli Frost**: I’m Oli Frost. I make novelty songs about the climate crisis. I also work freelance for places like Greenpeace UK and [create content](https://olifro.st/blog/oli-frost-with-greenpeace-uk/) for their channels as well.

I used to play hip-hop songs on a recorder as [Recorda Boi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52dnwXso6bs), and that was what I was doing prior to starting to work on the climate crisis — I made a song and then I made another one and now I’ve made 15 because it seems to be something that I enjoy.

****Munsell:**** You seem to have a knack for going viral online, even before you started doing the novelty songs. I’d love to hear more about that.

**Frost:** There was Recorda Boi, which was more of a performance-based thing, and I did that on _Britain’s Got Talent_. But before that, I was doing more like internet-based stunts.

I [sold all my personal data](https://www.vice.com/en/article/3k4ay8/sell-facebook-data-ebay-oli-frost) on eBay, which generated a [lot](https://www.cnet.com/culture/you-can-buy-oli-frost-personal-facebook-data-just-not-on-ebay/) of [press](https://nypost.com/2018/05/30/facebook-user-auctions-his-personal-data-on-ebay-for-99-cents/?itm_source=parsely-api?itm_campaign=parsely_recommended_widget-2&itmMedium=site_widget&itmSource=parsely_recommended_widget&itm_content=widget_item-1). That was around the time personal data and privacy was becoming a big conversation. And I made this \[other\] [website](https://olifro.st/blog/lifefaker/) where you could download people’s Instagram pictures and fake your own perfect online life, which tapped into the conversation around social media and mental health.

I found making websites soul-destroying. But the recorder thing was quite fun. So I realized it was about doing what I like doing and then focusing on one issue that I thought I could stick to.

**Munsell:** Many of your projects have some sort of activist bent. Is that something that happened by chance, or was it intentional?

**Frost:** With all the things I tried, I figured out that satire is what I enjoyed. And satire inevitably ends up being about causes and issues. So it ends up being an activist kind of space, inevitably.  

**Munsell**: Can you talk a little bit more about the inspiration behind the song?

**Frost:** I was working on something else — making stickers — and I wrote the line, “Greta doesn’t eat feta.” And that just sort of emerged into a lot of other rhymes: Greta doesn’t wear leather. Greta is very clever.

I really pushed the limits of what rhymes with “Greta.” I hadn’t finished a song before, but I had just left my normal job and clearly had too much time.

**Munsell:** Was the song pandemic-inspired at some level?

**Frost:** Well, it was around before the pandemic, but the pandemic gave me the time to dedicate to it.

**Munsell:** And then at some point, Greta got a hold of the song and did her own music video for it, right?

**Frost:** Yeah. That’s just one of those strange accidents that happen on the internet when something gets enough views. I think she was hanging out with some people from [Fridays for Future](https://fridaysforfuture.org/) Scotland, and they must have spent the day doing this kind of [shot-for-shot remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdwXHTJyq94). It was quite wild.

After that, I did a song about [pirates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0XGC2-d9Gg) — kind of a sea shanty — that was inspired by documentaries like [_Seaspiracy_](https://www.seaspiracy.org/). And that was more of a story-based one.
