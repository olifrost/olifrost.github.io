The festive season is upon us. Every pub and bar in the land is packed with jolly office workers and Christmas revellers getting their drink on. And outside every establishment, sequined smokers blow ash into each others’ mulled wines.

December is when all the social smokers reemerge, high on Christmas spirit(s), ready to steal other people’s cigs.

And it’s also a time where seasoned smokers puff away with vigour, safe in the knowledge that no one gives a crap about health concerns until 1 January.

With that in mind, we bring you news that you can now get your very own personalised health warning label just in time for Christmas.

Following the move to introduce plain packaging, creative team [Oli + Josie](http://oliandjosie.com/about/) have developed a way of printing your own smoking health warnings.

Their website [Personalise A Cigarette Pack](http://personaliseacigarettepack.oliandjosie.com/) lets you add any name to the ‘Smoking Kills’ warning on cigarette packets.

‘We’ve seen loads of these sorts of campaigns recently, like Nutella,’ Oli Frost tells Metro.co.uk.

‘Coke did “share a Coke with mum/dad/Ben”, and then every other brand copied it. We just thought what would happen if we did the idea for health warnings?’

‘With Christmas coming up, it’s an easy stocking filler for the smoker in your life or a way to remind that family member of a good New Year’s resolution.’

You can write anything under ‘Smoking Kills’. Your mate’s name. Your mum. Your boss. Anyone and everyone can now find fame on a fag packet.

But does Oli really think smokers are going to care enough about a unique label to quit, or that people are going to start printing off the labels?

‘In a way it doesn’t matter if people use them – it’s just more of a fun way to remind people about a serious issue.’

It’s just the latest in a series of projects from the pair who set up the [Homeless Period Campaign](http://oliandjosie.com/thehomelessperiod/).

‘What do you do when you’re homeless and on your period? There was no help when we started and it became quite a successful campaign,’ Oli explains.

‘It was something that we made with no money at all and yet still managed to have a far reach and impact.’

The pair managed to collect over 110,000 signatures on a petition to give shelters an allowance to buy sanitary products for destitute women. They’re now searching for a PM to present their campaign in parliament.
