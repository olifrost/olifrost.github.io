In the wake of [recent scandals](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-third-party-app-access-updated-cambridge-analytica/) like [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/facebook-cambridge-analyica-privacy-tool/)‘s misuse of personal information from 87 million users on Facebook, consumers and lawmakers are questioning how we can protect ourselves and our data from abuse. One social media user, 26-year old Oli Frost, has taken the contrarian position and embraced the sharing of his information by selling his own data online. Taking a page out of Facebook’s and Google’s own playb00k on selling their users’ information to data miners and advertisers, Frost wanted a piece of that profit and is doing the selling himself.

“There were loads of emails from companies over the last week about GDPR \[General Data Protection Regulation\], saying how valuable and important my data was to them,” Frost said to Motherboard in an email exchange. “I realized that I’d been selling my data for free for ages, and decided it was time to cash in.”

Frost listed his Facebook data with a starting bid of 99 cents on [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Im-selling-my-private-Facebook-data-/273239941454), according to [Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k4ay8/sell-facebook-data-ebay-oli-frost), drawing as many as 43 bidders, with the highest bid at $385 as of May 29, with five days remaining on the auction. Frost intends to donate the proceeds to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit committed to championing privacy and free expression on the internet. However, at the time of writing, the auction has been taken down, and it’s unclear if Frost had completed any transaction to sell his personal data through the site. It’s still unknown how much any single user’s online data is valued at on the open market.

To compile his data, Frost used a [Facebook-provided tool](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-expands-download-your-information-feature-fails-to-satisfy-critics/) to download [all his information from the social network](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-data-download/), including “every, like, post and inane comment since I was 16.” That data also included all his photos, interests, political affiliations, and “where all my family live.” Although Frost isn’t concerned if his data will be misused, he does mention a caveat prohibiting the winning bidder from stealing his identity to open a sweatshop.

Data privacy has been a big [public issue](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/polls-show-low-trust-facebook/), and in Europe, the [General Data Privacy Regulation](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-the-gdpr/) recently went into effect to give consumers more control over their online data, mandating that companies like Facebook are only permitted to collect data in a legal manner and are obligated to protect data from [misuse](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/cubeyou-suspended-accused-facebook-data-misuse/). Failure to comply can result in hefty fines for internet companies, and Facebook and Google [faced lawsuits on the first day](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-facebook-gdpr-lawsuit/) that GDPR went into effect.

Pocket is about to close. Use this read-it-later app instead

Read-it-later app Pocket is closing down in just a week’s time, so if you’re still using it, now’s the time to switch to a similar app.

As an avid user of Pocket pretty much since it launched in 2007 as Read It Later, I felt a little sad to receive a message in May informing me that it would be shutting down on July 8.

A coding blunder just ruined a moment of joy for lottery winners

Imagine the joy of being notified of a huge lottery win. What would be the first thing you’d do? Get the champagne in? Book a fancy vacation? Call your boss and tell him where to go?

And then imagine being informed that the notification had, in fact, been sent in error. Well, you can always send the booze back and cancel the holiday, but trying to convince your boss that you were just joking ... well, that may be a bigger challenge.
