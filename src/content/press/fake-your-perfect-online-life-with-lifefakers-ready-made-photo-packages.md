# fake your perfect online life with lifefaker's ready-made photo packages

**lifefaker is the world’s first online life-faking service, where users can sign up by purchasing packages that range from photos of perfect pets, holidays and meals, and post them as their own.** the website offers thousands of ready-made photo packages to fake a perfect life on social media such as **[instagram](https://www.designboom.com/tag/instagram/)** and **[facebook](https://www.designboom.com/tag/facebook/)** without the trouble of actually living it. 

**uk-based [oli frost](http://olifro.st/) developed [lifefaker.com](http://lifefaker.com/) as a service that offers users other people’s  photos with permission to fake another identity.** packages such as ‘my unachievable body’, filled with toned abs – and, fittingly, no heads – and ‘look what I had for lunch’ packed with avocados on toast and granola bowls are accompanied by catchy captions to complete your perfect online persona. each package costs $1 per month, a cost that covers the site’s partner influencers who ‘are guaranteed to be cooler, hotter, and happier than you.’

**while the project may have ‘black mirror’ written all over it,  the real purpose of lifefaker is to remind users of the pressures of social media, highlighting that 62% of people feel inadequate when comparing their lives to those online.** part of a campaign by mental health startup **[sanctus](https://sanctus.io/)**, the site confronts unhealthy behaviors that can harm our mental health and explores ways we can change them.
