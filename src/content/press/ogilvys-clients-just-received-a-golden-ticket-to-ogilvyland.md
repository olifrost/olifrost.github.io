# Ogilvy's Clients Just Received a Golden Ticket to Ogilvyland

Five major Ogilvy clients received golden tickets yesterday morning—but they won’t get them into Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory.

Instead, the tickets promise entry into Ogilvyland: a satirical fossil fuel funfair dreamed up by activists at the climate campaign group Serious People.

The hand-delivered package also included an “oilypop” and a letter to each company’s leaders, highlighting the conflicts between their own sustainability goals and the work that Ogilvy does for fossil fuel companies.

“Ogilvy’s worst nightmare is some of their big clients with with big commitments to sustainability just asking some questions,” Jamie Inman, co-founder of Serious People, told ADWEEK.
