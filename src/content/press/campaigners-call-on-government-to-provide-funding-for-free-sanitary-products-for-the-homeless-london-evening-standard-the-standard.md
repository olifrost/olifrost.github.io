# Campaigners call on Government to provide funding for free sanitary products for the homeless | London Evening Standard | The Standard

Homeless shelters should receive funding to offer free sanitary products to rough sleepers, campaigners have urged.

A [petition](https://www.change.org/p/help-the-homeless-on-their-period-thehomelessperiod) calling on the Government to give shelters money to buy tampons and sanitary towels has attracted more than 80,000 signatures so far.

Campaigners say shelters should be given funding to provide sanitary products in the same way as condoms.

The Homeless Period campaign interviewed a woman called Patricia who tore up rags to use as makeshift sanitary protection during the six months she was homeless.

Patricia used to sleep on a bus in Brixton, south London, and her story features in The Homeless Period campaign video.

The campaign was set up by Josie Shedden, 24, Oliver Frost, 24 and Sara Bakhaty, 30, after meeting as interns at London advertising company BBH.

The trio were inspired to find “a creative solution to a social issue” after reading an article about female homelessness.

Ms Bakhaty told the Standard: “The film is a one minute shortened down version of what was about two hours talking to her and we talked about how she felt very vulnerable, how she became very resourceful.”

Patricia used to visit public toilets to wash herself to avoid people noticing that she was homeless.

She added: “For her, if she bled or she appeared to be homeless that would then put her in a vulnerable position and she might get unwanted attention.”

Supporters across the country have been using crowdfunding websites to raise money to buy sanitary products to donate to homeless shelters.

The group believe that most people don’t realise that sanitary products aren’t already available at shelters.

Ms Bakhaty said: “It seemed so obvious to us so I think there's an assumption that it would be a service that's already offered.”

According to government figures, the number of rough sleepers in London rose by 37 per cent last year. Almost a third of the nation’s homeless population live in the capital.

Matt Downie, Director of Policy & External Affairs at homeless charity Crisis, said: “Homelessness is a horrifying experience that leaves people desperate, frightened and alone. It can be a struggle to find even the most basic of essentials. We hope this campaign will succeed in making sure homeless women can at least get sanitary products when they need them.”
