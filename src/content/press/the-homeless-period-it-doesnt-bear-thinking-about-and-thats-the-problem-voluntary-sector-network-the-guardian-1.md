# The Homeless Period: it doesn't bear thinking about and that's the problem | Voluntary Sector Network | The Guardian

## What’s it all about?

Three interns – Sara Bakhaty, Oliver Frost, and Josephine Shedden – who met at advertising agency [BBH](http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/london/) – read an article on [Vice](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/for-homeless-women-having-a-period-isnt-just-a-hassle-its-a-nightmare-124), describing the humiliation and suffering of women on the streets without access to sanitary products. They decided to do something about it. Their mission statement on The Homeless Period [website](http://thehomelessperiod.com/) reads: “This initiative believes that tampons and towels should be made available through homeless shelters, the same way the government provides condoms.” They’ve just reached more than 100,000 signatures on their petition aimed at making this a reality.

## How did it all start?

They created a low budget but moving [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egDmmfKj7Zs) (made with borrowed equipment and filming resources from BBH). They recorded it with Patricia, a woman who experienced homelessness for six months in Brixton and whom they contacted through a local homelessness charity, [Spires](http://www.spires.org.uk/). The video has been viewed more than 65,000 times and the campaign [has been covered in mainstream media](http://blog.thehomelessperiod.com/page/2). It appears with the strap line “It doesn’t bear thinking about… and that’s the problem.” In the video, Patricia poignantly details the dehumanising experience of being without anything other than a dirty cloth during menstruation. It’s an effective way to drive the point home: we’d just rather not think about it.

## But we’re tired of periods. Everything is about periods at the moment

True. With the WaterAid [#ifmenhadperiods](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/28/what-if-men-had-periods) campaign that featured [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOMPS2zkE1M) parody of Manpons (now seen by over a million people) and [Menstrual Hygiene Day](http://menstrualhygieneday.org/) it’s been a heavy month.  

## So what’s different about this one?

I’m so glad you asked me that –it’s genuinely grassroots: unprompted, social-media followers are taking independent action. The creators admit they never expected this level of interest. It started with the video, which has now inspired multiple [crowdfunding](http://blog.thehomelessperiod.com/) and sanitary product collection projects to pop up across Europe, the US and [Australia.](http://junkee.com/why-are-australian-women-still-being-penalised-for-getting-their-periods/55917) [Thousands of pounds has been raised](http://blog.thehomelessperiod.com/) through crowdfunding.  

The founding team don’t manage these other projects, they support them on social media instead and they are very clear that they are “not set up to take money”. From Cardiff, Bristol, and Glasgow to Vienna and Detroit, their Twitter feed is a steady flow of retweets of others’ activism. Those they’ve inspired are often connecting with their local foodbanks and homeless shelters in a way they might not have done before the campaign. It’s all rather 2015.

## **What helped it catch on?**

Bakhaty has a theory: “ It’s because very few people in the UK would regard sanitary products as a luxury item. I certainly never think twice about buying tampons. Do you?” Which may help explain why the campaign has been a hit in wealthier countries. People have been moved to take action when faced with the same question homeless women often are: tampons or food?

## **What we like about it**

It’s a big idea with a tiny team behind it. Sure, they’re media types who work in advertising, but their success shows what a camera, social media and a modest amount of resource can do. We also liked how they featured Patricia’s own words to tell the story of the indignities a lack of sanitary towels and tampons creates. For three interns doing this in their spare time it’s all pretty impressive.

## **100,000 signatures is great but what’s next?**

That is the big question facing these guys. If they really are to achieve their aim of free provision of sanitary towels and tampons in homeless shelters in the UK, they have a rather daunting road ahead.

Any e-petition that gains over 100,000 sign ups can [start the process](http://www.parliament.uk/e-Petitions-and-the-Backbench-Business-Committee) for a debate in parliament. But it’s a long road to a full parliamentary debate. Then, of course, it’s just the small matter of convincing parliament and the ever generous Treasury.

## **Ah, that’s a bit unlikely isn’t it?**

Yes it is. But stranger things have happened. Imagine people at opposite sides of the world spontaneously going to their local shops and buying several hundred tampons to drop off at their local homeless shelter. (Oh wait, that’s exactly what The Homeless Period’s Twitter followers have done.)
