# "Instagreen", a website that helps you fake an un-ecofriendly life on Instagram : r/InternetIsBeautiful

Hey, I’m [Oli Frost](https://olifro.st/) the Founder and CEO of [Instagreen](https://olifro.st/instagreen). I’d love to hear your feedback and ideas for the service, along with any questions.

I adore the satire of this. It's draining seeing the amount of fake, show-off lifestyles on Instagram and your photo packs show how easy it is! Excellent work

You need a #vanlife package. Maybe if my Instagram posts make me look happy and cool enough I finally will be!

I’ve seen a few of those van life videos on YouTube and I just don’t understand. I guess some of them are part of that social media flex, sure, but I don’t know, it’s probably just me who would never want to live like that.

I’m really glad you liked it. I actually do like the outdoors and minimalism but I think what you call change is where my hangups are. I would hate the logistics of figuring out where to park so that I won’t get towed and other stuff like that.

You could still like all three of those things and not like van life, but if you don't like any of those 3, then you won't like van life.

It’s the same reason people adopt puppies and take them to the shelter when they grow up. Or pay to pose on a fake private jet with a fake champagne glass. I legitimately think some people enjoy their #vanlife, most of them though are just trying to convince us they’re enjoying it so they look whimsical and interesting.

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/LetsAskJeeves/)

My god, I don't want to believe people actually do that with dogs... That's awful.

I’m sure you’re right. Instagram lifestyle stuff is very common and for some is quite lucrative. But in terms of people who actually like it, it just kinda blows my mind. I watched a few #vanlife videos of this one guy and it was mentally exhausting. He’s just like looking around for places he won’t get towed and it wasn’t for me.

I have a van that I live in most of the spring/summer,/early fall, not full time because living in a van when it's -30°c out sounds miserable. If you like outdoors and traveling, and can finance it it's nice, but honestly it's not for most people. If you actually travel and don't just sit on someones driveway, it's lot more expensive than people think

Van life is what happens when introverted vegans realize they hate everything about modern society.

Gotta add an 'Actually, 70% of Pollution is From Corporations' package that showcases expensive computer tech, the latest phones, crypto setups, etc. for us discerning Redditors.

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/realolifrost/)

Thanks, I’ve passed this on to our development team. Well, it’s just me. But…

Always hilarious when i see that stat because the only consistent thing is the 70/100 numbers, what they represent changes each time.

The actual statistic btw is 70% of corporate emissions (not global emissions) are caused by 100 companies.

Excellent idea! Curated lifestyle photos so people can impress others, which is what so much of social media is about. With minimal effort! Why the hell not.

Why does my left knee hurt so much more than my right knee? As far as I know I haven’t sustained a knew injury or anything.

Are you sure you didn't take an arrow to the knee?

God I would love to see influencers driven out of work. Thier content is no longer original and anyone can do it

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/yhu420/)

Is this really satire? In the sense that if someone offered you money for the service, would you do it?

[More replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/wiipj8/comment/ijdosso/)

Brilliant idea! I would second the tech subcategory suggestion for the "Have All The Things", since 90% of those fancy gadgets is beyond my budget.

Tagline: All of the benefits of unboxing videos, and none of the bills.

On the “I own the things” collection, I’m seeing some older phone models.

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/HedgiesKhansuckme/)

I want to buy your service but there are no burning man pictures! Totally unacceptable!

Oh shiz it’s RecordaBoi, ur a legend m8.

Recorder crew! Thank you.

This is so on the nose it’s hilarious and a little uncanny. Someone I follow posted a story of themselves at a place extremely similar to the one in #officefortheday and even used the same hashtag

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtoothpaste/)

What about a package of makeup and beauty products?

Yes, with the obligatory freshly manicured hand just casually resting on a Porsche steering wheel or an LV bag.

More themes. What if I’m a producer but don’t really need a balling studio, except to have it on my instagram and attract clients?

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/ToughHardware/)

how much money does this get each month?

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional_Fee/)

Two ideas, one for content one for a mechanic:

The technologically ignorant but boastfully rich gamer stereotype. Brand name, top-end-ignoring-quality hardware, and and a borderline moviestar-abusive room that _totally vibes_.

And maybe a "stories" at the top, it could just be a bunch of ignorant inspirational quotes, smothered in emojis on a background filter even. Feels like influencers never post movies or real moments to their stories, it's just another means to farm views for the same photos they already posted to the account.

Couldn’t someone just reverse image search and see that my pics are fake?

Comment removed by moderator

The [r/quityourbullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/) crowd _will_ feel obliged to do it!

However, reverse search only works if the material exists anywhere on the internet and if search engines have managed to index it. Judging by this on the Instagreen website:

> Each package on Instagreen is only $1 a month – a fraction of the cost of real life.

> \[...\]

> The cost covers a licensing fee we pay to our partner influencers who are some the most talented polluters on earth.

I understand the people (or guy) behind the "service" will provide you with photos on a monthly basis, ideally original and _non-indexed_ material. Finally, images on IG are never indexed, at least by Google, so you can't really trace any image back to an IG account.

If they’re wondering why I’m suddenly rich and travelling the world they might get nosy 😂

it's a joke website, none of the photo-packages actually work.

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/realolifrost/)

There was an error in the <a> link tag, so the download button didn't work. I've fixed it.

Now I am confused: The download button already worked for me, but the `InstagreenSample.zip` file, which every "get photos" button linked to, isn't really a zip file that you can unpack.

So I just checked it: it's an HTML-file with the same content as your root url (`index.html` in your project probably).

Edit: turns out it actually works in Chrome (you get an 38MB zip file with the images) , but not in Firefox. but it works in Firefoxs private-browsing-mode.

Edit2: works in Firefox now too, after removing all the cached site data.

Edit3: now it doesn't work in Firefox anymore... no idea. probably still some caching going on.

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/realolifrost/)

Probably some cacheing. It's working for me in Firefox.

<a href=""> was missing <a href="" download> which I thought was alright, but seems to act strangely in a React app.
