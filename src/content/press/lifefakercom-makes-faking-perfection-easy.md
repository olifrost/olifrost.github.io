Notice that the URL posted to HN had a tracking parameter attached to it (“?HackerNews”). I didn’t bother to look at the code on the site, but I noticed that Adblock Plus blocked 4 elements on the page, so maybe they’re already doing this. Even just with the YouTube-based promo video embedded on the page, you can retarget people that watched the video.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

But kids who grew up in the 00s, notably after the iPhone came out in 06, grew up very differently. The internet wasn't a precious resource, but an always available utility ready to be consumed at will.</p><p>This generation is growing up in a never ending onslaught of advertisements and peer pressure the likes of which we didn't experience. They are all guinea pigs for the Facebooks of the world, subjects of the A/B psychographic targeting grind.

Because people have a drive to maximize any score publicly connected to an identity they, er, identify with?

High karma posts are pushed forward and get a lot of attention and high karma users are seen as valuable members because they've brought quality content/commentary to the communities.

In my own coaching I try to make sure goals have intrinsic motivation, not based on what other people think. For example a bad motive is "I want to have big muscles so others will respect me", vs a good motive is "I want to have big muscles so I will feel better about myself". So don't have a party just to show off on Facebook how a good life you have, instead, forbid cameras and enjoy yourself.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

Obviously, such photos would need to be also human vetted but this could open up a lot of possibilities.</p><p>And sure, this site is fake but I don't think instagram insanity is going away just with site pointing to mental health considerations. You'd need to change society, how people relate to fame and so-forth.</p><p>Letting literally everyone fake perfection actually seems more plausible as a way to escape the insanity of everyone wanting to be celebrity compared to links to psychologists talking about problems.

Shut down your computers. Click off your iPods and your televisions and everything you listen to that isn’t human. Modern society has surrounded us with these things and they’re killing us. We’re beginning to forget what it is simply to breathe and eat and laugh and watch and wonder and listen and experience one another. We’re forgetting how to be human beings with actual opinions and genuine feelings and originality. And if we can’t be human, how can we ever hope to be artists"</p><p>This guy who taught acting classes for 30 years, is able to see clearly what technology has done for human contact.</p><p>If you think about it, it really makes sense that there's something really fundamental for us humans in acting.
