# 5 Times Activists Roasted Adland's Fossil Fuel Addiction

This year was [officially](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/06/climate/2023-hottest-year-climate/index.html#:~:text=This%20year%20will%20be%20the,increase%20from%20pre%2Dindustrial%20levels.) the hottest ever recorded, thanks to humans’ industrial-era obsession with burning fossil fuels. And despite a [weak, loophole-riddled agreement](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/cop28-is-over-heres-what-marketers-should-know-about-the-2024-climate-talks/) to transition away from those climate-warming fuels at the United Nations’ recent climate summit, the world is on track to see much more warming in the years to come.

Meanwhile, despite a [long history](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16092015/exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming/) of mis- and [disinformation from the oil and gas industry](https://drilled.media/podcasts/drilled/3/drilleds03-e01) and a recent [rollback of climate commitments](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/big-oil-climate-pledges-extreme-heat-fossil-fuel), hundreds of agencies—including all of the [largest ad agency holding companies](https://www.adweek.com/media/nearly-300-agencies-and-6-major-holding-companies-are-working-for-fossil-fuel-clients/)—continue to work with fossil fuel brands to improve brand image, promote oil and gas products and push back against the narratives of climate activists around the world.
