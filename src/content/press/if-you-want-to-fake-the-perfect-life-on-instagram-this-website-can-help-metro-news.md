According to Sanctus.io, 62% of people feel inadequate comparing their lives to others online.

And that’s not too hard to believe when you’re scrolling through Instagram in your PJs while everyone else seems to be crowd surfing at a gig/dining at a super fancy supper club/on an exotic beach.

What’s a millennial to do?

Fake your way to the most enviable online life, of course. And that’s what [LifeFaker.com](http://lifefaker.com/) is offering you the chance to do.

Dubbed ‘the world’s first online life faking service’, LifeFaker.com lets users buy ready-made photo packages that you can upload as pictures of your own life.

The site’s slogan reads: ‘Life isn’t perfect. Your profile should be. Instead of going to the trouble of living a perfect life, now you can just get the photos instead.’

Packages include the ‘Look at my Holiday and Cry’, the ‘My Sexy Girlfriend/Boyfriend’ and the ‘My Unachievable Body’.

So much darkness.

Or at least, it seems like a particularly dark episode of Black Mirror before you realise that LifeFaker.com is actually seeking to raise awareness of the negative impact social media is having on our mental health.

Anyone who tries to buy a package will be redirected to Sanctus, the startup behind the website, to explore just how unhealthy some behaviours on social media can be, and what we can do to change them.
