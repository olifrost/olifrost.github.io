# This Website Selling Fake Instagram Images Makes An Important Point About Mental Health And Social Media | Grazia

Life isn’t perfect, but your social media profile can be. That’s the tagline for [Lifefaker.com](http://lifefaker.com/), on the surface a website that sells fake Instagram pictures you can buy as a package to put on your profile and give off the illusion of the perfect online persona. In reality, Lifefaker.com is a satirical service, where when you actually click through to buy the fake photos you’re instead directed [Sanctus, a mental-health start-up](https://sanctus.io/social-media-mental-health-b1803b6b475f)website.

The fake website, Lifefaker.com, was set up by Sanctus in an effort to highlight the [unhealthy pressures of social media](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/facebook-instagram-quit-social-media-never-happier-happy-digital-detox/) and the [subsequent impact on people’s mental health](https://graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/news/social-media-stars-anxiety-depression/). By drawing in those who would normally purchase false images online, they’re attracting the very people that obviously feel an unhealthy pressure to appear perfect on social media and encouraging them to seek help.

This time last year, Instagram was rated [the worst social media platform](https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/instagram-worst-mental-health/) for young people’s mental health, and yet it continues to be one of the most popular apps. [The survey of 1,479](https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/instagram-ranked-worst-for-mental-health-in-teen-survey/)people found that Instagram scored highest for most likely to contribute to anxiety, depression, loneliness, bullying, body image issues and fear of missing out.

Essentially, the faux life many of us have online, only posting our best moments, actively make others feel worse about their own lives. While this isn’t news, the impact on our mental health is increasingly worrying.

Sanctus has set out to combat this, encouraging people to view their mental health in the same way as their physical, even planning to open the world’s first mental health gym. Stating that 62% of people feel inadequate comparing their lives to others online, the new charity is hoping to make ‘mental health cool’ and normalize talking about it, going into businesses for workshops on mental health and create an online community for people to share their stories.

And while the fake website may seem extreme to some, it’s proven a huge success, with over 100,000 people logging onto the site over three days and therefore raising tons of awareness about the somewhat unspoken subject.

Not only do the figures highlight just how many people actually purchase fake images for their social media, but also how many need support in dealing with the pressures of it. Now we can only help raise the profile of the charity to ensure more people are aware of the growing correlation between social media and mental health issues. With so many people attempting to create a false illusion of themselves in just three days, there’s clearly a need for it

### Omega 3

[Omega-3](http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2007/10/report_depression/Page-01) fatty acids are essential minerals which reduce inflammation and are vital to brain functions such as mood and memory. Your body doesn't produce them naturally so you can only get them in you via food (like fish, nuts and seeds) or dietary supplements.

### Vitamin D

In addition to bone health, Vitamin D can play a vital role in the areas of the brain that are linked to the development of depression and other mental health problems.

### S Adenosylemthionine

[SAMe](http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/investigating-sam-e-depression)is a molecule that the body naturally forms and is available as a dietary supplement. In addition to depression and anxiety, it can be used for many other conditions including heart disease, fibromyalgia, tendonitis and many more. It is also recommended for PMS. It works by making sure that chemicals in the body that play a role in pain, depression, liver disease, and other conditions, actually do their job.

### 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)

Like SAMe,[5-HTP](http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/5hydroxytryptophan-5htp) is also a chemical (an essential amino acid) that the body makes naturally. It works by helping to raise the serotonin (the happy hormone) levels in the brain. 5-HTP has been known to have a positive effect on sleep, mood, anxiety, appetite, and pain.

### Roseroot Herb

A [study conducted](http://www.techtimes.com/articles/42872/20150328/roseroot-herb-is-better-depression-treatment-than-conventional-drugs-heres-why.htm) on whether the Rhodiola Rosea (Roseroot) herb was [effective for depression](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/2015/03/mao/) showed that it was almost as effective as the popular antidepressant, Sertraline (Zoloft), but with fewer side effects. The herb boasts strengthening the nervous system, fighting depression, enhancing the immune system and memory, elevating stamina, aiding in weight-loss and increasing sexual function.

### Iron

A lot of adults, especially women, suffer from iron deficiency, and guess what? [Iron deficiency symptoms are pretty similar to depression](http://www.irondisorders.org/iron-deficiency-anemia) symptoms, i.e. fatigue, irritability, and foggy brain. The recommended daily iron allowance in adults is roughly 8 to 18 mg daily (check with your doctor though because everyone's number is different).

### Folate

If you don't have enough [folate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671130), antidepressants may not work. Some docs prescribe folate along with antidepressants to treat depression and improve the effectiveness the medication. Most adults need at least 0.4mg daily, which you can though food including dark leafy greens, beans and citrus fruit, or as a supplement.

### B12

[Vitamin B-12 and other B vitamins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15671130) can play a [role in producing mood-affecting brain chemicals](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/expert-answers/vitamin-b12-and-depression/faq-20058077) and low levels of these may be linked to depression. If you have a poor diet and the body can not absorb enough B vits, your mood can be severely affected. Getting a blood test will determine how much of the B goodness you have in your system, and whether you need to stock up. B vitamins are found in animal products like milk, fish, meat and eggs, so if you are a vegan, you should definitely be getting your B's from dietary supplements and vitamins.

### Zinc

[Zinc](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201309/zinc-antidepressant) is crucial to our system as it activates our digestive enzymes breaking down food, and helps prevent food allergies, which [can avert depression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3796297/). It also helps our DNA to produce and repair proteins, control inflammation and boost our immune system.

### Tryptophan

[Tryptophan](http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2013/5/Better-Brain-Chemistry-with-Tryptophan/Page-01) is an essential amino acid which you get through food such as bananas, tamarind, oats, sesame seeds, kiwi and watermelon. Once in the body, it converts to niacin, serotonin and melatonin. Most antidepressants work by increasing the amount of serotonin in the brain and [Tryptophan helps to increase serotonin levels](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-326-l-tryptophan.aspx?activeingredientid=326&activeingredientname=l-tryptophan)without the extreme side effects of meds.

### St John Wort

[St John's Wort](http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/st-johns-wort) has been around for yonks and is one of the most popular natural methods used for dealing with stress, anxiety and depression. It's a plant with yellow flowers. There has been some [scientific evidence](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/sjw-and-depression.htm) that St. John's wort may be helpful in treating mild depression.
