# Plant-based meat company vandalizes the bacon Wikipedia article - Boing Boing

A British company called [This](https://this.co/) makes plant-based meat alternatives. They also vandalize Wikipedia to promote their products.

On August 26th, a now-blocked Wikipedia user called "[This Isn't Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:This_Isn%27t_Bacon)" removed the first three photos in Wikipedia's "Bacon" article and replaced them with photos of what appears to be the company product. Wikipedia [is not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_or_means_of_promotion) a billboard, and editors quickly reverted the company's changes. However, on September 10th, User:[This Isn't Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:This_Isn%27t_Bacon) undid the changes. According to the [revision history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bacon&action=history), the second vandalism attempt was only up for 24 minutes.

The company took to social media to show off its edits. In a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6842719477944193024/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6842052871010316289%2C6842719462832132096)), Co-founder Andy Shovel posted a screenshot of the changes with the caption "I wonder how long we'll get away with this." The company [shared the stunt](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTo3G1HKfIF/) on its Instagram page, too; the caption gloats "THIS™ Isn't Bacon".

[This](https://this.co/) isn't the first company to use the online encyclopedia for brand promotion. In 2019, North Face changed high-traffic Wikipedia images to [subtly show North Face products](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18646538/north-face-wikipedia-google-search-apology-free-advertising-policy-violation). The move caused the brand to face scrutiny from both the public and The Wikimedia Foundation. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/business/north-face-wikipedia-leo-burnett.html):

> "But, in its statement, Wikipedia likened the campaign to defacing public property: 'They have risked your trust in our mission for a short-lived marketing stunt.'"

I'm all for creative promos, and I like alternative meat, but unethically manipulating Wikipedia is not the way to go.
