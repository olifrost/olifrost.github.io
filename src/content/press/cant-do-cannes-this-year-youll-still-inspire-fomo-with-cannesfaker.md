# Can't Do Cannes This Year? You'll Still Inspire FOMO With 'Cannesfaker'

CANNES, Frances—You may have heard rumors that attendance at this year’s Cannes Lions Festival is down—and that’s not just because of [all the Publicis employees](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/one-year-later-publicis-groupe-has-no-regrets-about-eliminating-awards-shows/) who had other places to be.

Fear not, ad pros. If you’re absent from the festival but still every bit as eager for peer approval, you can pretend to be enjoying the sights, sounds and panels of southern France thanks to a tidy new tool called [Cannesfaker,](http://lifefaker.com/cannes/) which provides all the content you need to show the folks back home that you’ve finally made it.

But wait … there just might be a catch.
