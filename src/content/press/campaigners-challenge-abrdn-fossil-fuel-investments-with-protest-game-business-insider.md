# Campaigners challenge abrdn fossil fuel investments with protest game - Business Insider

A group of 'eco-gamers' called Serious People have organised a protest against abrdn, creating a video game that aims to expose the extent of the firm's investment in fossil fuels.

In Asset Manager Quest, players take on the role of abrdn’s chief executive, with decisions to be made on its sustainable future.

To promote this, Serious People are today challenging employees and abrdn leadership to play the game via a portable arcade machine set up outside its Edinburgh offices.

Staff not based in the capital have had the game delivered to their inbox, while the general public may have encountered it through billboards in Edinburgh and adverts on LinkedIn.

Jamie Inman, founder of Serious People, commented: “We all want to breathe clean air and live in a thriving natural world, but abrdn is stuck in the past, pumping billions into fossil fuel companies while the planet heats up.

“Abrdn are toying with our future, so we thought we would play with theirs - having tried every turnaround plan except this one, it’s time for abrdn’s chairman and board to take a bold leap into the future and walk away from fossil fuel bonds.”

Oli Frost, lead game designer at Serious People, said: “Asset Manager Quest is an immersive text-based game with hundreds of possible paths, you can join secret covens, fight undead horses and enter celestial realms, but the most important thing you can do is stop investing in companies that continue to expand fossil fuels.

“The game’s graphical capabilities may be somewhat dated, but no more so than abrdn’s disastrous investment strategy.“

Alice Delemare Tangpuori, coordinator of the Toxic Bonds Network, added: “Every investment abrdn makes in toxic bonds helps fund a new oil pipeline or coal-fired power station.

“Its refusal to stop investments in coal, oil and gas amidst mounting public pressure and financial woes is a testament to its shortsightedness.“

The campaign group claimed that abrdn is currently the fourth most exposed asset manager to 'toxic bonds' and has more than $3.6bn invested in fossil fuel fixed income issued by the likes of Exxon, BP, Shell and Total.

The asset manager also holds bonds and shares issued by Ithaca Energy, co-developer of the controversial Rosebank oilfield. Serious People also pointed out that despite telling campaigners in 2023 that it was reviewing its interests, abrdn remains one of the few European investors without a coal exclusion policy.

Abrdn has been contacted for comment.
