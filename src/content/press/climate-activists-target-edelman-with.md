Yesterday (22 May), the climate campaign group Serious People launched a mobile app called Oilwell and staged a protest at
Edelman's London offices.
The app includes meditations that ironically address climate-related disasters, with titles such as Smog Breathing Exercise,
Drought Meditation and Drowning Mindfully.
Twelve campaigners from Serious People gathered at Edelman's offices at 8.4gam for the protest.
The campaign group claims there is a "dangerous conflict of interest" in Edelman's dual work across public health and high-
emissions industries.
Jamie Inman, a campaigner at Serious People, said: "Edelman pumps out oil and gas PR and expects people to put up with the
damage to us and the planet."
Inman argued that the health and wellbeing sector represents an "Achilles heel" for PR agencies linked to fossil fuels,
highlighting that "Edelman clients like AstraZeneca are prioritising action on climate".
"The conflict between health work and fossil-fuel work is clear to see. Edelman is going to have to pick a side," he added.
Oliver Frost, who identifies as the "spiritual lead" at Serious People, described the action as not a traditional protest, but a
"mindful acceptance practice".
"Edelman's fossil-fuel PR exists to keep us calm about the climate crisis. We've simply taken the next step in turning them into
meditations," Frost explained.
"Rather than telling Edelman to stop helping fossil-fuel companies expand, we're learning to live with the chaos it'll cause.
Together we meditated on droughts, drowning and forest fires," he added.
his approach by Serious People marks a departure from more traditional direct-action protests, such as the recent red paint

vandalism at APCO's company.
Previous climate-related actions against Edelman include, in 2023, Extinction Rebellion's protest outside the agency's London
office, hand-delivering letters to staff and installing a 'green-washing line' which called for Edelman to 'cut the ties with fossil
fuels'.
More recently, over 3o health organisations the fossil-fuel industry.

PRWeek contacted Edelman for comment on the latest protest.
Edelman is the fourth-largest PR agency in the UK, according to PRWeek's latest UK Top 150 Consultancies table.
