Oli Frost, 26, reached a bid of £300 on eBay for his Facebook data

**A man has put all of his Facebook data up for sale on eBay, sparking a bidding war.**

Former Britain’s Got Talent contestant and entrepreneur Oli Frost put all of the data Facebook had acquired on him since he was 16 years of age up for sale on the e-commerce website last week.

Oil, 26, said: ‘Everyone else was selling my data, so I decided to get in on the money.

Facebook sells my data every day so why couldn’t I sell mine?’

[The bid](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:BN1pTzqUJiwJ:https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/All-my-personal-Facebook-data-/273239941454+&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk), which began on Saturday, started at only 99p but quickly grew to reach the £300 mark.

His data was acquired using a Facebook tool that allows anyone to download a complete record of their Facebook activity.

According to the listing, the data includes ‘every like, post, and inane comment since I was 16’, ‘photos dating back to when I had a fringe and listened to Billy Talent’, and ‘loads more, like who I vote for, my boss’s name, and where all my family live.’

Frost gave one stipulation for buying the data, saying he didn’t give permission to ‘steal his identity and open a sweatshop’.

Frost offered to give all of the money raised to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organisation that champions internet privacy.

Frost is no stranger to publicity stunts, having already appeared on Britain’s Got Talent under the alias ‘Recorda Boi’, as well as creating e-commerce ideas like ‘Flopstarter’ – a crowdfunding platform for terrible start up ideas, and ‘Lifefaker’ – a fake app that supposedly makes your life look perfect on social media but was actually a ploy to raise awareness about the effect of social media on mental health.

The bidding was eventually stopped at £300 and taken down by eBay because it ‘might go against Facebook’s terms and conditions’, but private offers are still being accepted via [Oli’s blog.](http://olifro.st/blog/data-on-ebay/)
